We established a novel protocol for metabolomic and lipidomic profiling of colorectal cancer organoids by liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) facing the challenge of capturing metabolic information from a minimal sample amount (<500 cells/injection) in the presence of an extracellular matrix (ECM). The best procedure of the tested protocols included ultrasonic metabolite extraction with acetonitrile/methanol/water (2:2:1, v/v/v) without ECM removal. To eliminate ECM-derived background signals, we implemented a data filtering procedure based on the p-value and fold change cut-offs, which retained features with signal intensities >120% compared to matrix-derived signals present in blank samples. As a proof-of-concept, the method was applied to examine the early metabolic response of colorectal cancer organoids to 5-fluorouracil treatment. Statistical analysis revealed dose-dependent changes in the metabolic profiles of treated organoids including elevated levels of 2 '-deoxyuridine, 2 '-O-methylcytidine, inosine and 1-methyladenosine and depletion of 2 '-deoxyadenosine and specific phospholipids. In accordance with the mechanism of action of 5-fluorouracil, changed metabolites are mainly involved in purine and pyrimidine metabolism. The novel protocol provides a first basis for the assessment of metabolic drug response phenotypes in 3D organoid models.

Metabolic fingerprinting is a non-targeted procedure where all detectable peaks are considered to establish sample classification. A total of 40 compounds were identified as major metabolites contributing to the difference among five different probiotic lactic acid bacteria. Some of the metabolites identified in this study have been reported as a defrosting agent, antioxidant, flavour agent, antimicrobial, natural food additive, anti-inflammatory, anti-sleep disorder agent and anti-cancer agents. These results suggest that GC-MS based metabolomic analysis is a useful tool to facilitate future investigations into the characterization of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.

Statistically Driven Metabolite and Lipid Profiling of Patients from the Undiagnosed Diseases Network	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							GAS-CHROMATOGRAPHY; LARGE-SCALE; LC-MS; DEFICIENCY; SAMPLES; SERUM	Advancements in molecular separations coupled with mass spectrometry have enabled metabolome analyses for clinical cohorts. A population of interest for metabolome profiling is patients with rare disease for which abnormal metabolic signatures may yield clues into the genetic basis, as well as mechanistic drivers of the disease and possible treatment options. We undertook the metabolome profiling of a large cohort of patients with mysterious conditions characterized through the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN). Due to the size and enrollment procedures, collection of the metabolomes for UDN patients took place over 2 years. We describe the study designed to adjust for measurements collected over a long time scale and how this enabled statistical analyses to summarize the metabolome of individual patients. We demonstrate the removal of time-based batch effects, overall statistical characteristics of the UDN population, and two case studies of interest that demonstrate the utility of metabolome profiling for rare diseases.

However, which metabolic pathways are activated following treatment often remains elusive. The combination of chicken embryo tumor models (in ovo) with metabolomics phenotyping could offer a robust platform for drug testing. Here, we assess the potential of this approach in the treatment of an in ovo triple negative breast cancer with doxorubicin. Methods: MB-MDA-231 cells were grafted in ovo. The resulting tumors were then treated with doxorubicin or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for six days. Tumors were collected and analyzed using a global untargeted metabolomics and comprehensive lipidomics. Results: We observed a significant suppression of tumor growth in the doxorubicin treated group. The metabolic profiles of doxorubicin and DMSO-treated tumors were clearly separated in a principle component analysis. Inhibition of glycolysis, nucleotide synthesis, and glycerophospholipid metabolism appear to be triggered by doxorubicin treatment, which could explain the observed suppressed tumor growth. In addition, metabolic cancer survival mechanisms could be supported by an acceleration of antioxidative pathways. Conclusions: Metabolomics in combination with in ovo tumor models provide a robust platform for drug testing to reveal tumor specific treatment targets such as the antioxidative tumor capacity.

An example is the use of brain microdialysis samples from rats to study neurological disorders by means of a metabolomics approach. From an analytical point of view, the profiling of (endogenous) metabolites in rat brain microdialysates is challenging because of the limited sample volume for both sample preparation and injection, notably in longitudinal studies. In this work, we have assessed the analytical performance of capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) for the direct profiling of endogenous metabolites in rat brain microdialysates, i.e. without using any sample preparation or derivatization. An on-line preconcentration procedure with sample stacking, which was fully compatible with the high-salt concentration in microdialysates, was used to significantly improve the detection sensitivity of the CE-MS method for metabolic profiling. A response surface methodology, applying a Box-Behnken design, was considered to determine the optimal conditions for preconcentration. A linear response (R-2 > 0.99) for selected metabolites in the concentration range from 0.05 to 10 mu M was obtained in perfusate samples. Interday RSD values for peak area and migration time were 2.6-19% and below 3.8%, respectively. Limits of detection ranged from 11 to 284 nM when employing an injection volume of about 291 nL, corresponding to 17% of the total capillary volume. The utility of the CE-MS approach was demonstrated by the direct profiling of endogenous metabolites in rat brain microdialysates. At least 48 compounds could be analyzed of which 25 were provisionally identified and quantified.

Prediction of VLCAD deficiency phenotype by a metabolic fingerprint in newborn screening bloodspots	BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-MOLECULAR BASIS OF DISEASE			English	Article						VLCADD; Newborn screening; Untargeted metabolomics	ACID BETA-OXIDATION; INBORN-ERRORS; CHAIN; GENOTYPE	Purpose: Newborns who test positive for very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD) in newborn screening may have a severe phenotype with early onset of life-threatening symptoms but may also have an attenuated phenotype and never become symptomatic. The objective of this study is to investigate whether metabolomic profiles in dried bloodspots (DBS) of newborns allow early phenotypic prediction, permitting tailored treatment and follow-up. Methods: A metabolic fingerprint was generated by direct infusion high resolution mass spectrometry in DBS of VLCADD patients (n = 15) and matched controls. Multivariate analysis of the metabolomic profiles was applied to differentiate subgroups. Results: Concentration of six acylcarnitine species differed significantly between patients and controls. The concentration of C18:2- and C20:0-carnitine, 13,14-dihydroretinol and deoxycytidine monophosphate allowed separation between mild and severe patients. Two patients who could not be prognosticated on early clinical symptoms, were correctly fitted for severity in the score plot based on the untargeted metabolomics. Conclusion: Distinctive metabolomic profiles in DBS of newborns with VLCADD may allow phenotypic prognostication. The full potential of this approach as well as the underlying biochemical mechanisms need further investigation.	[Knottnerus, Suzan J.

Methods and results Our primary study cohort included 1859 participants from the Spanish PREDIMED trial, and validation cohorts included 6868 participants from the US Nurses' Health Studies I and II, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (NHS/HPFS). Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was assessed using a validated Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), and plasma metabolome was profiled by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We observed substantial metabolomic variation with respect to Mediterranean diet adherence, with nearly one-third of the assayed metabolites significantly associated with MEDAS (false discovery rate<0.05). Using elastic net regularized regressions, we identified a metabolic signature, comprised of 67 metabolites, robustly correlated with Mediterranean diet adherence in both PREDIMED and NHS/HPFS (r=0.28-0.37 between the signature and MEDAS; P=3x10(-35) to 4x10(-118)). In multivariable Cox regressions, the metabolic signature showed a significant inverse association with CVD incidence after adjusting for known risk factors (PREDIMED: hazard ratio [HR] per standard deviation increment in the signature = 0.71, P<0.001; NHS/HPFS: HR=0.85, P=0.001), and the association persisted after further adjustment for MEDAS scores (PREDIMED: HR=0.73, P=0.004; NHS/HPFS: HR=0.85, P=0.004). Further genome-wide association analysis revealed that the metabolic signature was significantly associated with genetic loci involved in fatty acids and amino acids metabolism. Mendelian randomization analyses showed that the genetically inferred metabolic signature was significantly associated with risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke (odds ratios per SD increment in the genetically inferred metabolic signature = 0.92 for CHD and 0.91 for stroke; P<0.001). Conclusions We identified a metabolic signature that robustly reflects adherence and metabolic response to a Mediterranean diet, and predicts future CVD risk independent of traditional risk factors, in Spanish and US cohorts.

Methods The FF samples were obtained from participants (N = 26) who were receiving IVF under the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) long protocol stimulation and were collected separately from small (8-13 mm) and large (17-22 mm) follicles at the time of oocyte retrieval. Metabolomic analysis of the FF samples was performed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Results The results demonstrated that the size of the follicle influences the metabolic signature of the FF according to the profile and differential metabolites. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), which is enriched in steroid hormone biosynthesis, correlated negatively with the oocyte maturation rate and the high-quality embryo rate, and thus could be used to estimate the predictive diagnostic potential of follicular development. Conclusion The FF has different metabolic characteristics in different stages of follicular development. Exploring meaningful metabolites could predict follicular development, and modifications of these metabolites could influence follicular development.

They display remarkable plasticity by changing their phenotype and function in response to environmental cues representing a spectrum of different functional phenotypes. The so-called M1 and M2 macrophages are often considered as representative of pro- and anti-inflammatory ends of such spectrum. Metabolomics approach is a powerful tool providing important chemical information about the cellular phenotype of living systems, and the changes in their metabolic pathways in response to various perturbations. Objectives This study aimed to characterise M1 and M2 phenotypes in THP-1 macrophages in order to identify characteristic metabolites of each polarisation state. Methods Herein, untargeted liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolite profiling was applied to characterise the metabolic profile of M1-like and M2-like THP-1 macrophages. Results The results showed that M1 and M2 macrophages have distinct metabolic profiles. Sphingolipid and pyrimidine metabolism was significantly changed in M1 macrophages whereas arginine, proline, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism was significantly altered in M2 macrophages. Conclusion This study represents successful application of LC-MS metabolomics approach to characterise M1 and M2 macrophages providing functional readouts that show unique metabolic signature for each phenotype. These data could contribute to a better understanding of M1 and M2 functional properties and could pave the way for developing new therapeutics targeting different immune diseases.

Cholecystectomy modifies the kinetics of BAs, and whether this procedure influences the BAs pool and its metabolic response to bariatric surgeries is not known. We used targeted and untargeted metabolomics to assess whether cholecystectomy influenced plasma and fecal BAs fluctuations and the systemic metabolomic profile after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Women with obesity and type 2 diabetes were included. Sample collections and clinical evaluations were performed before and 3 months after RYGB. RYGB influenced 9 fecal and 3 plasma BAs in patients with cholecystectomy (p <= 0.05). Comparisons between patients with and without cholecystectomy revealed different concentrations of 4 fecal and 5 plasma BAs (p <= 0.05). Cholecystectomy impacted the global metabolomics responses to RYGB, and patients who underwent the gallbladder removal also lacked some significant improvements in clinical markers, primarily the lipid profile. By affecting the BAs concentrations, cholecystectomy seems to alter the systemic metabolic response to RYGB. Therefore, cholecystectomy may act as a bias in assessments of the metabolic effects of bariatric surgeries and their relationships with clinical outcomes.

Untargeted metabolomic profiling identifies disease-specific signatures in food allergy and asthma	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						Asthma; food allergy; invariant natural killer T cells; metabolomics; metabolites; secondary bile acids; sphingolipids; tryptophan	GUT MICROBIOTA; BILE-ACID; SPHINGOLIPIDS; CHILDREN; CELLS; PREVALENCE; PROTEINS; LESSONS; OMICS	Background: Food allergy (FA) affects an increasing proportion of children for reasons that remain obscure. Novel disease biomarkers and curative treatment options are strongly needed. Objective: We sought to apply untargeted metabolomic profiling to identify pathogenic mechanisms and candidate disease biomarkers in patients with FA. Methods: Mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomic profiling was performed on serum samples of children with either FA alone, asthma alone, or both FA and asthma, as well as healthy pediatric control subjects. Results: In this pilot study patients with FA exhibited a disease-specific metabolomic signature compared with both control subjects and asthmatic patients. In particular, FA was uniquely associated with a marked decrease in sphingolipid levels, as well as levels of a number of other lipid metabolites, in the face of normal frequencies of circulating natural killer T cells. Specific comparison of patients with FA and asthmatic patients revealed differences in the microbiota-sensitive aromatic amino acid and secondary bile acid metabolism. Children with both FA and asthma exhibited a metabolomic profile that aligned with that of FA alone but not asthma. Among children with FA, the history of severe systemic reactions and the presence of multiple FAs were associated with changes in levels of tryptophan metabolites, eicosanoids, plasmalogens, and fatty acids. Conclusions: Children with FA have a disease-specific metabolomic profile that is informative of disease mechanisms and severity and that dominates in the presence of asthma. Lower levels of sphingolipids and ceramides and other metabolomic alterations observed in children with FA might reflect the interplay between an altered microbiota and immune cell subsets in the gut.

Accounted for various adversities to biological functions, it could alter the expression of endogenous metabolites in many metabolic processes. The study was aimed to investigate the altered metabolites in hyperglycemic condition triggered by sub-chronic exposure of BPS in serum and urine samples of Wistar rats. Invaded effects of hyperglycemia due to BPS exposure on Wistar rats were investigated by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT). Metabolomic profiling of serum and urinary metabolites was done by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The metabolomics data were represented by one way ANOVA, principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) along with the mapping of perturbed metabolic pathways. The OGTT and ITT showed increased levels of glucose in treated animals with median and high doses, indicating the manifestation of hyperglycemia. The metabolomic profiling of serum and urine revealed BPS could cause consequential metabolomic perturbation mainly of amino acids, sugars, and organic acids. Furthermore, the extrapolation of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) based systematic analysis helped to monitor the altered pathways, including amino acids, glycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, etc., which were provoked due to BPS exposure. The overview of the perturbed metabolite profiling in rats promisingly showed early diagnostic markers of hyperglycemic condition triggered due to the BPS exposure. Findings from this study will be helpful towards the exploration of mechanistic insights of several disturbed pathways.

With the emergence of omics techniques, mapping of the molecular response to exercise is increasingly accessible. Here, we perform an untargeted metabolomics profiling of plasma from a randomized, within-subjects, crossover study of either endurance exercise or resistance exercise, two types of skeletal muscle activity that have differential effects on human physiology. A high-resolution time-series analyses reveal shared as well as exercise-mode-specific perturbations in a multitude of metabolic pathways. Moreover, the analyses reveal exercise-induced changes in metabolites that are recognized to act as signaling molecules. Thus, we provide a metabolomic signature of how dissimilar modes of exercise affect the organism in a time-resolved fashion.

Methods and results We prospectively recruited 32 healthy individuals and 42 consecutive patients with HF who underwent CRT between January 2018 and January 2019. Peripheral venous blood samples, clinical data, and echocardiographic signatures were collected before CRT implantation. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to perform untargeted metabolites profiling for peripheral plasma under ESI+ and ESI- modes. After 6 month follow-up, patients were categorized as CRT responders or non-responders based on the alterations of echocardiographic characteristics. Compared with healthy individuals, patients with HF had distinct metabolomic profiles under both ESI+ and ESI- modes, featuring increased free fatty acids, carnitine, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and dysregulated lipids with heterogeneous alterations such as phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and sphingomyelins. Disparities of baseline metabolomics profile were observed between CRT responders and non-responders under ESI+ mode but not under ESI- mode. Further metabolites analysis revealed that a group of 20 PCs metabolites under ESI+ mode were major contributors to the distinct profiles between the two groups. We utilized LASSO regression model and identified a panel of four PCs metabolites [including PC (20:0/18:4), PC (20:4/20:0), PC 40:4, and PC (20:4/18:0)] as major predictors for CRT response prediction. Among our whole population (n = 42), receive operating characteristics analysis revealed that the four PCs-based model could nicely discriminate the CRT responders from non-responders (area under the curve = 0.906) with a sensitivity of 83.3% and a specificity of 90.0%. Cross-validation analysis also showed a satisfactory and robust performance of the model with the area under the curve of 0.910 in the training dataset and 0.880 in the testing dataset. Conclusions Patients with HF held significantly altered plasma metabolomics profile compared with the healthy individuals. Within the HF group, the non-responders had a distinct plasma metabolomics profile in contrast to the responders to CRT, which was characterized by increased PCs species. A novel predictive model incorporating four PCs metabolites performed well in identifying CRT non-responders. These four PCs might severe as potential biomarkers for predicting CRT response. Further validations are needed in multi-centre studies with larger external cohorts.

Previous metabolomic studies show that metabolic signatures in plasma distinguish CRC patients from healthy controls. Chronic enteritis (CE) represents a risk factor for CRC, with a 20 fold greater incidence than in healthy individuals. However, no studies have performed metabolomic profiling to investigate CRC biomarkers in CE. Objective Our aims were to identify metabolomic signatures in CRC and CE and to search for blood-derived metabolite biomarkers distinguishing CRC from CE, especially early-stage biomarkers. Methods In this case-control study, 612 subjects were prospectively recruited between May 2015 and May 2016, and including 539 CRC patients (stage I, 102 cases; stage II, 259 cases; stage III, 178 cases) and 73 CE patients. Untargeted metabolomics was performed to identify CRC-related metabolic signatures in CE. Results Five pathways were significantly enriched based on 153 differential metabolites between CRC and CE. 16 biomarkers were identified for diagnosis of CRC from CE and for guiding CRC staging. The AUC value for CRC diagnosis in the external validation set was 0.85. Good diagnostic performances were also achieved for early-stage CRC (stage I and stage II), with an AUC value of 0.84. The biomarker panel could also stage CRC patients, with an AUC of 0.72 distinguishing stage I from stage II CRC and AUC of 0.74 distinguishing stage II from stage III CRC. Conclusions The identified metabolic biomarkers exhibit promising properties for CRC monitoring in CE patients and are superior to commonly used clinical biomarkers (CEA and CA19-9).

Metabolite profiling has significantly contributed to a deeper understanding of the biochemical metabolic networks and pathways in disease, but the biochemical details in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients remain largely undefined. Methods: The metabolic fingerprinting of plasma samples from 19 MHD patients and 12 healthy controls was characterized using liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were applied to analyze the metabolic data. Results: The plasma metabolite profile distinguished the MHD patients from the healthy controls successfully by using both PCA and OPLS-DA models. Sixty-three metabolites were identified as the key metabolites to discriminate the MHD patients from healthy controls, involving several metabolic pathways (all p < 0.05). An increase in plasma levels of D-glucose, hippuric acid, androsterone glucuronide, indolelactic acid, and a reduction in plasma levels of glycerophosphocholine, serotonin, L-lactic acid, phytosphingosine, and several lysophosphatidylcholine were observed in MHD patients compared to healthy subjects. Metabolomics analysis combined with KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, choline metabolism in cancer, the forkhead box O signaling pathway, and the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 signaling pathway in MHD patients were significantly changed (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The identification of a novel signaling pathway and key metabolite markers in MHD patients provides insights into potential pathogenesis and valuable pharmacological targets for end-stage renal disease.

A more comprehensive survey of the changes in their chemical composition was made on selected samples using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) metabolomic profiling with high resolution accurate mass/tandem mass spectrometry (HRAM/MSn). Principal component analysis (PCA) of the metabolite fingerprints showed four clusters for the two genetic lines (responsive and non-responsive) and the two CO2 levels (ambient and elevated) in score plots. Metabolite profiling of representative samples for each of the four clusters identified 25 and 16 compounds from negative and positive data, respectively, including amino acids, saccharides, phenolic acids, flavonoids, and lipids. Loading plots demonstrated that some saccharides and lipids were responsible for discriminating between not only two genetic lines but also two CO2 levels. Analysis of free amino acids (not bound) showed a clear pattern of reduced concentration for both lines with elevated CO2. After acid hydrolysis, the responsive line 6 (41% increase in yield) showed the same pattern observed for free amino acids, but the non-responsive line 5 (6% increase in yield) showed different trends in concentrations of amino acids with elevated CO2.

Identifying unknown metabolites using NMR-based metabolic profiling techniques	NATURE PROTOCOLS			English	Article							NUCLEAR-MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; TOTAL CORRELATION SPECTROSCOPY; MHZ H-1-NMR SPECTROSCOPY; ANGLE-SPINNING NMR; 2-DIMENSIONAL SPECTROSCOPY; INFORMATION RECOVERY; BIOMARKER DISCOVERY; BIOLOGICAL-FLUIDS; DRUG-METABOLISM; BLOOD-PLASMA	Metabolic profiling of biological samples provides important insights into multiple physiological and pathological processes but is hindered by a lack of automated annotation and standardized methods for structure elucidation of candidate disease biomarkers. Here we describe a system for identifying molecular species derived from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy-based metabolic phenotyping studies, with detailed information on sample preparation, data acquisition and data modeling. We provide eight different modular workflows to be followed in a recommended sequential order according to their level of difficulty. This multi-platform system involves the use of statistical spectroscopic tools such as Statistical Total Correlation Spectroscopy (STOCSY), Subset Optimization by Reference Matching (STORM) and Resolution-Enhanced (RED)-STORM to identify other signals in the NMR spectra relating to the same molecule. It also uses two-dimensional NMR spectroscopic analysis, separation and pre-concentration techniques, multiple hyphenated analytical platforms and data extraction from existing databases. The complete system, using all eight workflows, would take up to a month, as it includes multi-dimensional NMR experiments that require prolonged experiment times. However, easier identification cases using fewer steps would take 2 or 3 days. This approach to biomarker discovery is efficient and cost-effective and offers increased chemical space coverage of the metabolome, resulting in faster and more accurate assignment of NMR-generated biomarkers arising from metabolic phenotyping studies. It requires a basic understanding of MATLAB to use the statistical spectroscopic tools and analytical skills to perform solid phase extraction (SPE), liquid chromatography (LC) fraction collection, LC-NMR-mass spectroscopy and one-dimensional and two-dimensional NMR experiments. Nicholson et al. describe a system for identifying molecular species derived from nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-based metabolic phenotyping studies, with detailed information on sample preparation, data acquisition and modeling. They recommend eight modular workflows to be followed in sequential order.

In this study, a comprehensive investigation of various sampling methods and storage conditions on the metabolomic profile of fish muscle was performed based on in vivo and ex vivo sampling. The GlobalStd algorithm and structure/reaction directed analysis under a linear mixed model were used to investigate the distinctive influences of these factors on the metabolomic profiles of fish tissue obtained via untargeted LC-MS analysis. Immediate analysis of samples yielded different metabolomic profiles compared to that of stored samples. Storage time was found to affect the metabolomic profile in a complex way, whereas storage temperature was shown to not substantially change this pattern. At the reaction level, metabolites involved in homologous series with butylation were shown stable during storage. Overall, our findings demonstrate that immediate instrumental analysis after in vivo solid phase microextraction (SPME) sampling and a reverse time series experimental design should be the preferred approaches for metabolomic profiling if unstable compounds are of interest.

Unfortunately, little is known about how HAuCl4 is converted to AuNPs, and the toxicity of HAuCl4 affects the mechanisms underlying metabolite shifts in algae. The aim of this work is to systematically study the cellular metabolism profile of the green alga Ulva prolifera upon exposure to HAuCl4 by using metabolomics based on nontargeted liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The results showed that the metabolite profiles of UpAu (treatment) and UpC (control) were clearly separated, as revealed by PCA and PLS-DA. A total of 200 metabolites and 16 specific metabolic pathways were significantly altered by exposure to HAuCl4, many of which are associated with the cellular stress response and AuNP synthesis. Importantly, the expression levels of crotonobetaine, ascorbic acid, jasmonic acid, ubiquinol, and vitamin D-3 involve in stress-related metabolites increased, and those of secondary metabolites such as diosgenin and hecogenin terpendole G, and steroids, as reducers, were also all significantly increased. In addition, the downregulated metabolites included linoleic acid, stearidonic acid and arachidonic acid, which affect membrane composition and stability. Importantly, a metabolic analysis identified some novel metabolic pathways that are specifically regulated by HAuCl4, including linoleic acid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, steroid biosynthesis, and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites regulated by HAuCl4. In summary, the manifestation of differential metabolic profiles combined with SEM analysis of exposure to HAuCl4 provided evidence of damage to photosynthesis and membranes. These results provide holistic information about complex disturbances in the metabolite profiles of U. prolifera exposed to HAuCl4 and provide new insights into the mechanisms of HAuCl4 toxicity and AuNP synthesis in macroalgae.

Variation in the synovial fluid metabolome according to disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis	CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RHEUMATOLOGY			English	Article						rheumatoid arthritis; metabolomics; synovial fluid; gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; disease activity	HYPOXIA	Objectives Because genetic and environmental factors both contribute to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), metabolomics could be a very useful tool to elucidate the pathophysiology of RA, and to predict response to treatment. This study was carried out to investigate synovial fluid (SF) metabolic perturbation in RA patients according to the degree of disease activity using gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC/TOF MS). Methods SF samples were obtained from 48 RA patients. Disease activity was assessed using DAS28-ESR(3). SF metabolomics profiling was performed using GC/TOF-MS, in conjunction with multivariate statistical analyses and pathway analyses. Results Significant discrimination of metabolite profiles between moderate and high disease activity groups was shown by PLS-DA, which provided evidence that SF metabolic profiles predicted disease activity. We found the significant correlation between DAS28-ESR(3) value and the intensities of 12 metabolites. The intensities of glycocyamine and indol-3-lactate positively correlated with DAS28-ESR(3) value. On the other hand, beta-alanine, asparagine, citrate, cyano-L-alanine, leucine, nicotinamide, citrulline, methionine, oxoproline, and salicylaldehyde negatively correlated with DAS28-ESR(3) value. We found fifteen pathways that were significantly associated with disease activity in RA and that the higher the disease activity, the more amino acid metabolic processes were affected. Conclusions We found the SF metabolic alterations in RA patients according to disease activity by using GC/TOF MS and identified 12 candidate metabolic biomarkers that may well reflect the disease activity of RA. SF metabolomic approaches based on GC/TOF MS might provide additional information relating to monitoring disease activity in RA.	[Ahn, J.

Rapid identification and novel approaches for the characterization of these fungi are of great interest to improve the diagnosis and the knowledge about their pathogenic properties. This study aimed to characterize clinical isolates of Candida spp. by proteomics (MALDI-TOF MS) and metabolomics (H-1-NMR), and to correlate their metabolic profiles with Candida species, source of infection and different virulence associated parameters. In particular, 49 Candida strains from different sources (blood, n=15; vagina, n=18; respiratory tract, n=16), belonging mainly to C. albicans complex (61%), C. glabrata (20%) and C. parapsilosis (12%) species were used. Several extracellular and intracellular metabolites showed significantly different concentrations among isolates recovered from different sources of infection, as well as among different Candida species. These metabolites were mainly related to the glycolysis or gluconeogenesis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, nucleic acid synthesis and amino acid and lipid metabolism. Moreover, we found specific metabolic fingerprints associated with the ability to form biofilm, the antifungal resistance (i.e. caspofungin and fluconazole) and the production of secreted aspartyl proteinase. In conclusion, H-1-NMR-based metabolomics can be useful to deepen Candida spp. virulence and pathogenicity properties.

The oxygen radical absorbance capacity (0.49 mM/g dry weight basis, dwb) and the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (0.46 mM/g dwb) were the highest for the doenjang samples with the lowest salinity. The consumer acceptability and intensity of sensory characteristics were evaluated by consumers (n = 147). The doenjang with the lowest salinity tended to have an increased bitterness and reduced umami taste, resulting in decreased consumer acceptance. Additionally, 39 and 24 metabolites were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Overall, the correlation between sensory attributes and metabolite profiles of doenjang showed that bitter taste was closely related to tyrosine and phenylalanine, while umami was highly related to glutamic and aspartic acids.

Metabolite profile comparisons between ascending and descending colon tissue in healthy adults	WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY			English	Article						Colon; Ascending; Descending; Metabolomics; Obesity; Stool	TRIMETHYLAMINE-N-OXIDE; COLORECTAL-CANCER; BILE-ACIDS; GLUCOSE-PRODUCTION; OBESITY; RISK; INFLAMMATION; PREDICTORS; MECHANISMS; PLASMA	BACKGROUND Obesity is a risk factor for colorectal cancer, yet metabolic distinctions between healthy right and left colon tissue, before cancer is diagnosed, remains largely unknown. This study compared right-ascending and left-descending colon tissue metabolomes to identify differences from the stool metabolome in normal weight, overweight, and obese adults. AIM To examine right and left colon tissue metabolites according to body mass index that may serve as mechanistic targets for interventions and biomarkers for colon cancer risk. METHODS Global, non-targeted metabolomics was applied to assess right-ascending and left-descending colon tissue collected from healthy adults undergoing screening colonoscopies to test the hypothesis that BMI differentially impacts colon tissue metabolite profiles. The colon tissue and stool metabolome of healthy adults (n = 24) was analyzed for metabolite signatures and metabolic pathway networks implicated in progression of colorectal cancer. RESULTS Ascending and descending colon contained 504 host, food, and microbiota-derived metabolites from normal weight, overweight and obese adults grouped according to body mass index. Amino acids, lipids, and nucleotides were among the chemical types that further differentiated from the stool metabolite profiles. Normal weight adults had 46 significantly different metabolites between ascending and descending colon tissue locations, whereas there were 37 metabolite differences in overweight and 28 metabolite differences for obese adults (P < 0.05). Obese adults had trimethylamine N-oxide, endocannabinoids and monoacylglycerols with different relative abundances identified between ascending and descending colon. Primary and secondary bile acids, vitamins, and fatty acids also showed marked relative abundance differences in colon tissue from overweight/obese adults. CONCLUSION There were metabolite profile differences between right-ascending and left-descending colon tissue in healthy adults. Colon lipids and other metabolites in obese and overweight adults were distinguished from normal weight participants and associated with gut inflammation, nutrient absorption, and products of microbiota metabolism.

Effects of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury on plasma metabolomic profile during aging	AGING CELL			English	Article						aging; heart disease; LC&#8208; MS; metabolism; metabolomics; myocardial ischemia	GLOBAL LONGITUDINAL STRAIN; HEART-FAILURE; ISCHEMIA-REPERFUSION; INFARCTION; ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY; INFLAMMATION; DISEASE; MODEL	Background Heart disease is a frequent cause of hospitalization and mortality for elderly patients. A common feature of both heart disease and aging itself is the involvement of metabolic organ alterations ultimately leading to changes in circulating metabolite levels. However, the specific contribution of aging and ischemic injury to the metabolic dysregulation occurring in older adults with ischemic heart disease is still unknown. Aim To evaluate the effects of aging and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury on plasma metabolomic profiling in mice. Methods Young and aged mice were subjected to a minimally invasive model of I/R injury or sham operation. Complete evaluation of cardiac function and untargeted plasma metabolomics analysis were performed. Results We confirmed that aged mice from the sham group had impaired cardiac function and augmented left ventricular (LV) dimensions compared to young sham-operated mice. Further, we found that ischemic injury did not drastically reduce LV systolic/diastolic function and dyssynchrony in aged compared to young mice. Using an untargeted metabolomics approach focused on aqueous metabolites, we found that ischemic injury does not affect the plasma metabolomic profile either in young or old mice. Our data also demonstrate that age significantly affects circulating metabolite levels (predominantly amino acids, phospholipids and organic acids) and perturbs several pathways involved in amino acid, glucid and nucleic acid metabolism as well as pyridoxal-5 '-phosphate salvage pathway in both sham and ischemic mice. Conclusions Our approach increases our understanding of age-associated plasma metabolomic signatures in mice with and without heart disease excluding confounding factors related to metabolic comorbidities.

Metabolic Signature of Articular Cartilage Following Mechanical Injury: An Integrated Transcriptomics and Metabolomics Analysis	FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR BIOSCIENCES			English	Article						cartilage; injury; osteoarthritis; transcriptomics analysis; metabolomics; arginine metabolic pathways; glycolysis (glycolytic pathway)	SYNOVIAL-FLUID; KNEE CARTILAGE; IN-VITRO; OSTEOARTHRITIS; EXPRESSION; IDENTIFICATION; SPECTROSCOPY; PROFILES	Mechanical injury to the articular cartilage is a key risk factor in joint damage and predisposition to osteoarthritis. Integrative multi-omics approaches provide a valuable tool to understand tissue behavior in response to mechanical injury insult and help to identify key pathways linking injury to tissue damage. Global or untargeted metabolomics provides a comprehensive characterization of the metabolite content of biological samples. In this study, we aimed to identify the metabolic signature of cartilage tissue post injury. We employed an integrative analysis of transcriptomics and global metabolomics of murine epiphyseal hip cartilage before and after injury. Transcriptomics analysis showed a significant enrichment of gene sets involved in regulation of metabolic processes including carbon metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, and steroid biosynthesis. Integrative analysis of enriched genes with putatively identified metabolite features post injury showed a significant enrichment for carbohydrate metabolism (glycolysis, galactose, and glycosylate metabolism and pentose phosphate pathway) and amino acid metabolism (arginine biosynthesis and tyrosine, glycine, serine, threonine, and arginine and proline metabolism). We then performed a cross analysis of global metabolomics profiles of murine and porcine ex vivo cartilage injury models. The top commonly modulated metabolic pathways post injury included arginine and proline metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and vitamin B6 metabolic pathways. These results highlight the significant modulation of metabolic responses following mechanical injury to articular cartilage. Further investigation of these pathways would provide new insights into the role of the early metabolic state of articular cartilage post injury in promoting tissue damage and its link to disease progression of osteoarthritis.

Two experiments based on either chronic (8 week) exposure to ethanol of both male and female mice or acute exposure of male mice for 11 days, plus 2 oral gavage doses of 25% ethanol, were undertaken. Marked differences were found in amino acids, nucleotides, nucleosides, and related metabolites as well as a number of different lipids. Using untargeted metabolite profiling, acute ethanol exposure found significant decreases in several metabolites including nucleosides, fatty acids, glycerophosphocholine, and a number of phospholipids, while chronic exposure resulted in increases in several amino acids with notable decreases in adenosine, acetylcarnitine, and galactosylceramides. Similarly, targeted metabolite analysis, focusing on the hydrophilic fraction of the brain tissue extract, identified significant decreases in the metabolism of amino acids and derivatives, as well as purine degradation especially after chronic exposure to ethanol.

Among all the clinical forms in OLP, reticular type has the highest incidence rate. Previous studies have applied metabolomics to investigate the metabolic changes of oral mucosa and blood samples from reticular OLP patients. Urinary metabolomic signatures is also useful in analyzing the pathological changes of the patients, which was a complement to the previous studies. Through these researches, we may have a more comprehensive understanding of the disease. Metabolic profiles of urinary samples from OLP patients and control subjects were analyzed by liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS) system. Differentially expressed metabolites were identified via OSI/SMMS software for the pathology analysis. Totally, 30 differentially expressed metabolites were identified. Pathological network showed that these metabolites participated in 8 pathological processes, that is, DNA damage and repair disorder, apoptosis process, inflammatory lesion, oxidative stress injury, carbohydrate metabolism disorder, mood dysfunction, abnormal energy expenditure, and other pathological process. These findings demonstrated that the analysis of human urine metabolome might be conducive to the achievement of the objectives of this study.

Herein, vanadium core-shell nanorods are developed for metabolic fingerprinting to probe molecular variation in DR. First, a series of vanadium core-shells are constructed with different elemental composition and structural parameters, using silica nanorods to support vanadium oxide. The plasma metabolic fingerprints (MFs) are extracted by the optimized vanadium core-shell nanorod-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, by analyzing 500 nL of native plasma in seconds. As a result, DR patients are differentiated from non DR controls with a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 90% using a classification model built on the plasma MFs. Furthermore, DR progression is monitored by a panel of plasma metabolic signatures with gradual changes. This work provides an advanced molecular tool for the metabolomic characterization of DR and may guide the clinical decision making in DR for personalized medicine in the future.

Adzuki beans (Vigna angularis) are cultivated worldwide, but there are no tools for accurately discriminating their geographical origin. Thus, our study aims to develop a method for discriminating the geographical origin of adzuki beans through targeted and non-targeted metabolite profiling with gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry combined with multivariate analysis. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis showed clear discrimination between adzuki beans cultivated in Korea and China. Non-targeted metabolite profiling showed better separation than targeted profiling. Furthermore, citric acid and malic acid were the most notable metabolites for discriminating adzuki beans cultivated in Korea and China. The geographical discrimination method combining non-targeted metabolite profiling and pareto-scaling showed excellent predictability (Q(2) = 0.812). Therefore, it is a suitable prediction tool for the discrimination of geographical origin and is expected to be applicable to the geographical authentication of adzuki beans.

This article presents data of fungi which were isolated from gold mine tailings and identified by DNA sequencing of their inter transcribed spacer regions 1 and 2. Five fungal isolates were identified, among which the crude extract of Penicillium janthinellum KTMT5 was investigated for anticancer activity on A549 (lung carcinoma) and UMG87 (glioblastoma) cell lines. Untargeted metabolite profiling of the crude extract of P. janthinellum KTMT5 was performed using liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight tandem mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS/MS) and a molecular network generated using the online workflow on the Global Natural Product Social molecular networking (GNPS) web-site. DNA sequencing showed that all fungal isolates belonged to phylum Ascomycota with the genus Penicillium representing 75% of the fungal isolates. P. janthinellum KTMT5 which was selected for further experiments showed significant anticancer activity against UMG87 cells with a calculated IC50 value of 44.23 mu g/mL in the MTS assay, while the real time xCELLigence assay showed dose-dependent anticancer activity at 50 and 100 mg/mL.

Metabolic fingerprinting reveals extensive consequences of GLS hyperactivity	BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-GENERAL SUBJECTS			English	Article						DI-HRMS; Untargeted metabolomics; Metabolic profiling; Glutaminase activity; Glutamate metabolism	MASS-SPECTROMETRY; GLUTAMINASE; INHIBITOR	Background High glutaminase (GLS;EC3.5.1.2) activity is an important pathophysiological phenomenon in tumorigenesis and metabolic disease. Insight into the metabolic consequences of high GLS activity contributes to the understanding of the pathophysiology of both oncogenic pathways and inborn errors of glutamate metabolism. Glutaminase catalyzes the conversion of glutamine into glutamate, thereby interconnecting many metabolic pathways. Methods: We developed a HEK293-based cell-model that enables tuning of GLS activity by combining the expression of a hypermorphic GLS variant with incremental GLS inhibition, The metabolic consequences of increasing GLS activity were studied by metabolic profiling using Direct-Infusion High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (DI-HRMS). Results and conclusions: Of 12,437 detected features [m/z], 109 features corresponding to endogenously relevant metabolites were significantly affected by high GLS activity. As expected, these included strongly decreased glutamine and increased glutamate levels. Additionally, increased levels of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) intermediates with a truncation of the TCA cycle at the level of citrate were detected as well as increased metabolites of transamination reactions, proline and ornithine synthesis and GABA metabolism. Levels of asparagine and nucleotide metabolites showed the same dependence on GLS activity as glutamine. Of the nucleotides, especially metabolites of the pyrimidine thymine metabolism were negatively impacted by high GLS activity, which is remarkable since their synthesis depend both on aspartate (product of glutamate) and glutamine levels. Metabolites of the glutathione synthesizing gamma-glutamyl-cycle were either decreased or unaffected. General significance: By providing a metabolic fingerprint of increasing GLS activity, this study shows the large impact of high glutaminase activity on the cellular metabolome.

Acidosis and lactic acidosis can induce different responses in tumors. Previous studies have associated the response to lactic acidosis of tumors with good survival outcomes. In this study, we investigated the metabolomic changes in triple negative and luminal subtype breast cancer cell lines in response to acidosis and lactic acidosis. Our results showed that acidosis results in the reduction of cell viability and glycolysis in breast cancer cells, which is reversely correlated with the malignancy of cell lines. Under lactic acidosis, this reduction is reversed slightly. Untargeted metabolomic profiling revealed that glutaminolysis and fatty acid synthesis in cancer cells under acidosis are increased, while TCA cycle and glycolysis are decreased. Under lactic acidosis, the pentose phosphate pathway and acetate release are increased in MDA-MB-231 cells. The current results uncovered the different metabolic responses of breast cancer cells to acidosis and lactic acidosis, demonstrating the power of combined untargeted and stable isotope assisted metabolomics in comprehensive metabolomic analysis.

However, mulberry leaves are seasonal resources, not available in the winter, which severely limits the silkworm rearing and cocoon production. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism that caused the stunted growth and the low efficiency of silk protein synthesis of silkworms fed with artificial diet by analyzing the fecal metabolome. Compared to silkworm reared with mulberry leaves, the contents of the amino acids, carbohydrates and lipids in the feces of silkworm fed with artificial diet obviously decrease, while some organic acids, such as urea and citric acid significantly increase. These findings provide new insights for the improvement of silkworm artificial feed through metabolomics research. Metabonomics accurately monitors the precise metabolic responses to various dietary patterns. Metabolic profiling allows simultaneous measurement of various fecal metabolites whose concentrations may be affected by food intake. In this study, we analyzed the fecal metabolomes of silkworm (Bombyx mori) larvae reared on fresh mulberry leaves and artificial diets. 57 differentially expressed metabolites were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Of these, 39 were up-regulated and 18 were downregulated in the mulberry leaf meal group. Most of the amino acids, carbohydrates and lipids associated with physical development and silk protein biosynthesis were enriched in silkworms reared on mulberry leaves. In contrast, the urea, citric acid, D-pinitol, D-(+)-cellobiose and N-acetyl glucosamine levels were relatively higher in the silkworm feeding on the artificial diets. The findings of this study help clarify the association between diet and metabolic profiling.

ACS is associated with metabolic abnormalities of lipid oxidation stress. In this study, based on liquid chromatograph mass spectrometry technique, we conducted the metabolic profiling analysis of serum samples from stable plaques (SPs) and vulnerable plaques (VPs) in ACS patients for exploring the potential biomarkers of plaque stability. The results showed that four differential metabolites were identified between the SPs and VPs, including betaine, acetylcarnitine, 1-heptadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and isoundecylic acid. Meanwhile, the diagnostic model was identified using stepwise logistic regression and internally validated with 10-fold cross-validation. We analyzed the correlations between serum metabolic perturbations and plaque stability, and the serum betaine and ejection fraction-based model was established with a good diagnostic efficacy [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.808, sensitivity = 70.6%, and specificity = 80.0%]. In summary, we firstly illustrate the comprehensive serum metabolic profiles in ACS patients, suggesting that the combined model of serum betaine and ejection fraction seems to be used as the potential diagnostic biomarker for the vulnerability of plaque stability.

Cell-specific metabolomic responses to injury: novel insights into blood-brain barrier modulation	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; ASTROCYTES; HYPOXIA; DEPRIVATION; EXPRESSION; SURVIVAL; PROTEIN; PROLIFERATION; ANGIOGENESIS; GLYCOLYSIS	On one hand blood-brain barrier (BBB) disturbance aggravates disease progression, on the other it prevents drug access and impedes therapeutic efficacy. Effective ways to modulate barrier function and resolve these issues are sorely needed. Convinced that better understanding of cell-oriented BBB responses could provide valuable insight, and the fact that metabolic dysregulation is prominent in many vascular-related pathological processes associated with BBB disturbance, we hypothesized that differential cell-specific metabolic adaptation majorly influences physiological and pathological barrier functionality. Untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomic profiling was used to obtain individual biochemical fingerprints of primary astrocytes (AC) and brain endothelial cells (EC) during normoxic conditions and increasing hypoxic/ischemic injury and thus a functional readout of cell status. Bioinformatic analyses showed each cell had a distinct metabolic signature. Corroborating their roles in BBB and CNS protection, AC showed an innate ability to dynamically alter their metabolome depending on the insult. Surprisingly, in complete contrast, EC largely maintained their normoxic characteristics in injury situations and their profiles diverged from those of non-brain origin. Tissue specificity/origin is clearly important when considering EC responses. Focusing on energy capacity and utilization we discuss how cell-specific metabolic adaptive capabilities could influence vascular stability and the possibility that altering metabolite levels may be an effective way to modulate brain EC function. Overall this work novel insight into cell-associated metabolic changes, and provides a powerful resource for understanding BBB changes during different injury scenarios.

The improvement in our understanding of the mechanisms of drought-resistance in moso bamboo benefits their genetic improvement and maintenance of forest sustainability. Here, we investigated the metabolic changes across the annual growth cycle of moso bamboo in the field under drought stress using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based on untargeted metabolomic profiling. Our results showed that the metabolic profiles induced by drought stress were relatively consistent among the three growth stages. Specifically, most responsive metabolites exhibited enhanced accumulation under drought stress, including anthocyanins, glycosides, organic acids, amino acids, and sugars and sugar alcohols. The potential metabolism pathways involved in the response to drought stress were mainly included into amino acid metabolism and sugar metabolism pathways. Five common responsive metabolic pathways were found among three growth stages, including linoleic acid metabolism, ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis, tyrosine metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism and isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis. Overall, our findings provide new insights into the responsive mechanisms of the moso bamboo under drought stress in terms of metabolic profiles. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A metabolomic approach emphasizing metabolic pathways is critical to our understanding of this heterogeneous disease. This study aimed to characterize the serum metabolomic fingerprint and multi-metabolite signatures associated with IR and T2DM. Here, we have used untargeted high-performance chemical isotope labeling (CIL) liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to identify candidate biomarkers of IR and T2DM in sera from 30 adults of normal weight, 26 obese adults, and 16 adults newly diagnosed with T2DM. Among the 3633 peak pairs detected, 62% were either identified or matched. A group of 78 metabolites were up-regulated and 111 metabolites were down-regulated comparing obese to lean group while 459 metabolites were up-regulated and 166 metabolites were down-regulated comparing T2DM to obese groups. Several metabolites were identified as IR potential biomarkers, including amino acids (Asn, Gln, and His), methionine (Met) sulfoxide, 2-methyl-3-hydroxy-5-formylpyridine-4-carboxylate, serotonin, L-2-amino-3-oxobutanoic acid, and 4,6-dihydroxyquinoline. T2DM was associated with dysregulation of 42 metabolites, including amino acids, amino acids metabolites, and dipeptides. In conclusion, these pilot data have identified IR and T2DM metabolomics panels as potential novel biomarkers of IR and identified metabolites associated with T2DM, with possible diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Further studies to confirm these associations in prospective cohorts are warranted.

Currently, researchers are exploring the therapeutic effects of EBN, such as cell growth promotion, antioxidant content. antiviral effects, bone strengthening, eyes care, and neuroprotection bioactivities. The therapeutic effects of EBN have been studied through different extraction methods but the metabolites profile of the EBN in each extract has not yet been elucidated. This study aimed to profile the water-soluble metabolites of EBN prepared in different extraction methods. Subsequently, an extraction method will be selected as an ideal extraction method for untargeted metabolite profiling on the water-soluble metabolites in EBN. Materials and Methods: In this study, water-soluble metabolites of EBN extracted by the four extraction methods were subjected to metabolite profiling through liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The extraction methods were acid extraction(ABN), pancreatic extraction (EzBN), eHMG extraction, and spray drying of HMG extraction (pHMG). The metabolite profiles, such as the number of metabolites and their identities in each extraction method, were evaluated through LC-MS analysis. Results: The identity of metabolites present in the four extraction methods is inconsistent. Based on LC-MS analysis, only one and six metabolites were extracted differently through EzBN and ABN, respectively, in the first pre-screening. Through the second LC-MS screening on pHMG and eHMG extraction methods, eHMG was selected as an ideal extraction method due to the highest numbers of water-soluble metabolites with an amount of 193 was detected. Besides, eHMG extraction method was able to extract sialic acid and a high percentage of secondary metabolites. Conclusion: This study suggests that eHMG is the ideal extraction method for extracting higher number of water-soluble metabolites from EBN and could be further developed as an extraction method for industry application. In addition, this study also has identified the types of primary and secondary metabolites present in EBN.

Metabolic response of the Siberian wood frog Rana amurensis to extreme hypoxia	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ANOXIA TOLERANCE; REPERFUSION INJURY; LC-MS; 2,3-BUTANEDIOL; GLYCEROL; SUCCINATE; ACCUMULATION; ISCHEMIA	The Siberian wood frog Rana amurensis is a recently discovered example of extreme hypoxia tolerance that is able to survive several months without oxygen. We studied metabolomic profiles of heart and liver of R. amurensis exposed to 17 days of extreme hypoxia. Without oxygen, the studied tissues experience considerable stress with a drastic decrease of ATP, phosphocreatine, and NAD+concentrations, and concomitant increase of AMP, creatine, and NADH. Heart and liver switch to different pathways of glycolysis with differential accumulation of lactate, alanine, succinate, as well as 2,3-butanediol (previously not reported for vertebrates as an end product of glycolysis) and depletion of aspartate. We also observed statistically significant changes in concentrations of certain osmolytes and choline-related compounds. Low succinate/fumarate ratio and high glutathione levels indicate adaptations to reoxygenation stress. Our data suggest that maintenance of the ATP/ADP pool is not required for survival of R. amurensis, in contrast to anoxia-tolerant turtles.

Mutations in succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) genes increase the risk for PPGLs and several other tumours. Mutations in subunit B (SDHB) in particular are a risk factor for metastatic disease, further highlighting the importance of identifyingSDHxmutations for patient management. Genetic variants of unknown significance, where implications for the patient and family members are unclear, are a problem for interpretation. For such cases, reliable methods for evaluating protein functionality are required. Immunohistochemistry for SDHB (SDHB-IHC) is the method of choice but does not assess functionality at the enzymatic level. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based measurements of metabolite precursors and products of enzymatic reactions provide an alternative method. Here, we compare SDHB-IHC with metabolite profiling in 189 tumours from 187 PPGL patients. Besides evaluating succinate:fumarate ratios (SFRs), machine learning algorithms were developed to establish predictive models for interpreting metabolite data. Metabolite profiling showed higher diagnostic specificity compared to SDHB-IHC (99.2% versus 92.5%,p = 0.021), whereas sensitivity was comparable. Application of machine learning algorithms to metabolite profiles improved predictive ability over that of the SFR, in particular for hard-to-interpret cases of head and neck paragangliomas (AUC 0.9821 versus 0.9613,p = 0.044). Importantly, the combination of metabolite profiling with SDHB-IHC has complementary utility, as SDHB-IHC correctly classified all but one of the false negatives from metabolite profiling strategies, while metabolite profiling correctly classified all but one of the false negatives/positives from SDHB-IHC. From 186 tumours with confirmed status ofSDHxvariant pathogenicity, the combination of the two methods resulted in 185 correct predictions, highlighting the benefits of both strategies for patient management.

We investigated the fecal microbiota and metabolome of wild and captive Chinese monals to explore differences and similarities in nutritional status and digestive characteristics. An integrated approach combining 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequencing and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) based metabolomics were used to examine the fecal microbiota composition and the metabolomic profile of Chinese monals. Results The results showed that the alpha diversity of gut microbes in the wild group were significantly higher than that in the captive group and the core bacterial taxa in the two groups showed remarkable differences at phylum, class, order, and family levels. Metabolomic profiling also revealed differences, mainly related to galactose, starch and sucrose metabolism, fatty acid, bile acid biosynthesis and bile secretion. Furthermore, strong correlations between metabolite types and bacterial genus were detected. Conclusions There were remarkable differences in the gut microbiota composition and metabolomic profile between wild and captive Chinese monals. This study has established a baseline for a normal gut microbiota and metabolomic profile for wild Chinese monals, thus allowing us to evaluate if differences seen in captive organisms have an impact on their overall health and reproduction.

Certain metabolites play a key role in ARDS and could serve as potential targets for developing therapies against this respiratory disorder. The present study was designed to determine such "functional metabolites" in ARDS using metabolomics and in vivo experiments in a mouse model. Methods Metabolomic profiles of blood plasma from 42 ARDS patients and 28 healthy controls were captured using Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) assay. Univariate and multivariate statistical analysis were performed on metabolomic profiles from blood plasma of ARDS patients and healthy controls to screen for "functional metabolites", which were determined by variable importance in projection (VIP) scores and P value. Pathway analysis of all the metabolites was performed. The mouse model of ARDS was established to investigate the role of "functional metabolites" in the lung injury and mortality caused by the respiratory disorder. Results The metabolomic profiles of patients with ARDS were significantly different from healthy controls, difference was also observed between metabolomic profiles of the non-survivors and the survivors among the ARDS patient pool. Levels of Phenylalanine, D-Phenylalanine and Phenylacetylglutamine were significantly increased in non-survivors compared to the survivors of ARDS. Phenylalanine metabolism was the most notably altered pathway between the non-survivors and survivors of ARDS patients. In vivo animal experiments demonstrated that high levels of Phenylalanine might be associated with the severer lung injury and increased mortality of ARDS. Conclusion Increased mortality of acute respiratory distress syndrome was associated with high levels of plasma Phenylalanine.

Adaptation to these changing conditions is a complex biological process that involves reprogramming of genes, proteins and metabolites. The metabolic response of medicinal plants along the altitude has been less explored yet. Objectives In the present study, we investigated the adaptation strategies ofPicrorhiza kurroaRoyle ex Benth. along the altitude in organ specific manner using metabolomic approach. Methods Picrorhiza kurroaplants at flowering stage were randomly sampled from three altitudes viz. 3400, 3800 and 4100 masl in the Himalayan region. Leaf, root and rhizome were used for LC-MS based non-targeted metabolite profiling and targeted analysis of sugars, amino acids, picrosides and their corresponding phenolic acids. Results A total of 220, primary and secondary metabolites (SMs) were identified (p < 0.05) representing an extensive inventory of metabolites and their spatial distribution inP. kurroa. Differential accumulation of metabolites suggests source-sink carbon partitioning, occurrence of partial TCA cycle, ascorbate metabolism, purine catabolism and salvage route, pyrimidine synthesis, lipid alteration besides gibberellins and cytokinin inhibition might be an adaptive strategy to alpine environmental stress along the altitude. Further, marked differences of organ and altitude specific SMs reflect alteration in secondary metabolic pathways. Significant accumulation of picrosides suggests their probable role inP. kurroaadaptation. Conclusion This study provides a platform that would be useful in deciphering the role of metabolites considered to be involved in plant adaptation.

The exploration of diet-related plasma metabolic profiles could help to better understand the impact of overall diet on health. Our aim was to identify metabolomic signatures reflecting overall diet in women from the French general population. Methods This cross-sectional study included 160 women in the SU.VI.MAX cohort with detailed dietary data (>= 10 24-h dietary records) selected according to their level of adherence to the French dietary recommendations, represented by the validated score mPNNS-GS; 80 women from the 10th decile of the score were matched with 80 women from the 1st decile. Plasma metabolomic profiles were acquired using untargeted UPLC-QToF mass spectrometry analysis. The associations between metabolomic profiles and the mPNNG-GS, its components and Principal Component Analyses-derived dietary patterns were investigated using multivariable conditional logistic regression models and partial correlations. Results Adherence to the dietary recommendations was positively associated with 3-indolepropionic acid and pipecolic acid (also positively associated with fruit and vegetable intake and a healthy diet)-2 metabolites linked to microbiota and inversely associated with lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC(17:1)), acylcarnitine C9:1 (also inversely associated with a healthy diet), acylcarnitine C11:1 and 2-deoxy-D-glucose. Increased plasma levels of piperine and Dihydro4mercapto-3(2H) furanone were observed in women who consumed a Western diet and a healthy diet, respectively. Ethyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside was positively associated with alcohol intake. Plasma levels of LysoPC(17:1), cholic acid, phenylalanine-phenylalanine and phenylalanine and carnitine C9:1 decreased with the consumption of vegetable added fat, sweetened food, milk and dairy products and fruit and vegetable intakes, respectively. Conclusion This study highlighted several metabolites from both host and microbial metabolism reflecting the long-term impact of the overall diet.

A better knowledge of the metabolite profiles of different processed and non-processed meat products from this heterogeneous food group could help in elucidating the mechanisms associated with these health effects. Thirty-three different commercial samples of ten processed and non-processed meat products were digested in triplicate with a standardized static in vitro digestion method in order to mimic profiles of small molecules formed in the gut upon digestion. A metabolomics approach based on high-resolution mass spectrometry was used to identify metabolite profiles specific to the various meat products. Processed meat products showed metabolite profiles clearly distinct from those of non-processed meat. Several discriminant features related to either specific ingredients or processing methods were identified. Those were, in particular, syringol compounds deposited in meat during smoking, biogenic amines formed during meat fermentation and piperine and related compounds characteristic of pepper used as an ingredient. These metabolites, characteristic of specific processed meat products, might be used as potential biomarkers of intake for these foods. They may also help in understanding the mechanisms linking processed meat intake and adverse health outcomes such as cancer.

The aim of this study was to examine the anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and ulceroprotective activity of Agave species in relation to their metabolite fingerprint via a metabolome based ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) approach coupled to chemometrics. The metabolomic differences among five examined Agave leaves viz. Agave americana L., A. americana var. marginata Trel, A. angustifolia Haw. cv. marginata, A. desmettiana Jacobi, A. pygmaea Gentry were determined via a total of 56 annotated metabolites. Identification based on MS" and UV spectra revealed 25 steroidal saponins and sapogenins, 6 flavonoids, 2 homoisoflavonoids, 7 phenolic acids, 6 fatty acids and 3 fatty acid amides, some of which are reported for the first time in Agave. Metabolites heterogeneity was assessed among leaf taxa via multivariate data analyses for samples classification, showing that saponins is the major metabolite contributing to their classification. The carrageenan induced acute inflammatory rat model was used to assess the anti-inflammatory activity of Agave extracts via monitoring of blood cytokine levels. Additionally, their effects on ethanol-induced gastric ulcer in rats were evaluated. A. pygmaea showed the most significant anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activity, while A. angustifolia var. marginata possessed the highest ulceroprotective activity, which could be attributable to the high abundance of various saponins and homoisoflavonoids in those taxa.

In the current study, we applied targeted metabolite profiling (LC/GC-MS) and untargeted H-1 NMR-based metabolomics in combination with biological assays to unveil TCC exposure-induced cellular metabolic responses in murine preadipocyte and human normal hepatocytes. We found that TCC promoted adipocyte differentiation in 3T3L1 preadipocytes, manifested by marked triglyceride (TG) and fatty acids accumulation, which were consistent with significant up-regulation of mRNA levels in the key adipogenic markers Fasn, Srebp1 and Ap2. In human hepatocytes (L02), TCC exposure dose-dependently interfered with the cellular redox state with down-regulated levels of antioxidant reduced-GSH and XBP1 and further induced the accumulation of TG, ceramides and saturated fatty acid (16:0). We also found that TCC exposure triggered unfold protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in both cells through activation of ATF4 and ATF6, resulting in toxic lipid accumulation. These findings about lipid metabolism and metabolic responses to TCC exposure in both preadipocytes and hepatocytes provide novel perspectives for revealing the mechanisms of TCC toxicity.

We investigated the effects of subclinical treatment with DON, and supplementation with probiotic yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii I1079 as a preventive strategy in piglets. Thirty-six animals were randomly assigned to either a control diet, a diet contaminated with DON (3 mg/kg), a diet supplemented with yeast (4 x 10(9) CFU/kg), or a DON-contaminated diet supplemented with yeast, for four weeks. Plasma and tissue samples were collected for biochemical analysis,H-1-NMR untargeted metabolomics, and histology. DON induced no significant modifications in biochemical parameters. However, lesion scores were higher and metabolomics highlighted alterations of amino acid and 2-oxocarboxylic acid metabolism. Administering yeast affected aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis and amino acid and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Yeast supplementation of piglets exposed to DON prevented histological alterations, and partial least square discriminant analysis emphasised similarity between the metabolic profiles of their plasma and that of the control group. The effect on liver metabolome remained marginal, indicating that the toxicity of the mycotoxin was not eliminated. These findings show that the H-1-NMR metabolomics profile is a reliable biomarker to assess subclinical exposure to DON, and that supplementation with S. cerevisiae boulardii increases the resilience of piglets to this mycotoxin.

The taxonomic identification of individual phytoplankton cells usually relies on their morphology and demands expert knowledge. Recently, a live single-cell mass spectrometry (LSC-MS) pipeline was developed to generate metabolic profiles of microalgae. Objective Taxonomic identification of diverse microalgal single cells from collection strains and plankton samples based on the metabolic fingerprints analyzed with matrix-free laser desorption/ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry. Methods Matrix-free atmospheric pressure laser-desorption ionization mass spectrometry was performed to acquire single-cell mass spectra from collection strains and prior identified environmental isolates. The computational identification of microalgal species was performed by spectral pattern matching (SPM). Three similarity scores and a bootstrap-derived confidence score were evaluated in terms of their classification performance. The effects of high and low-mass resolutions on the classification success were evaluated. Results Several hundred single-cell mass spectra from nine genera and nine species of marine microalgae were obtained. SPM enabled the identification of single cells at the genus and species level with high accuracies. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves indicated a good performance of the similarity measures but were outperformed by the bootstrap-derived confidence scores. Conclusion This is the first study to solve taxonomic identification of microalgae based on the metabolic fingerprints of the individual cell using an SPM approach.	[Baumeister, Tim U.

Understanding biological processes of aging in humans could help maintain a healthy aging trajectory and promote longevity. We performed untargeted plasma metabolomics quantifying 770 metabolites on a cross-sectional cohort of 268 healthy individuals including 125 twin pairs covering human lifespan (from 6 months to 82 years). Unsupervised clustering of metabolic profiles revealed 6 main aging trajectories throughout life that were associated with key metabolic pathways such as progestin steroids, xanthine metabolism, and long-chain fatty acids. A random forest (RF) model was successful to predict age in adult subjects (>= 16 years) using 52 metabolites (R-2 = .97). Another RF model selected 54 metabolites to classify pediatric and adult participants (out-of-bag error = 8.58%). These RF models in combination with correlation network analysis were used to explore biological processes of healthy aging. The models highlighted established metabolites, like steroids, amino acids, and free fatty acids as well as novel metabolites and pathways. Finally, we show that metabolic profiles of twins become more dissimilar with age which provides insights into nongenetic age-related variability in metabolic profiles in response to environmental exposure.

Then, targeted metabolomics was conducted with 3 growth year plants to identify 19 phenolic metabolites related to the above-mentioned active compounds, including 9 C6C3C6 -type, 6 C6C3-type, and 4 C6C1-type. Multivariate statistical analysis was applied to the bioactive metabolite data, and targeted metabolic profiling was used for marker compound classification and characterization. The results showed that 7 active compounds in the roots and stems in the 3 growth year plants differed. The principal component "Q" values showed that the total contents of 7 active compounds in 5-year-old roots and stems were higher than in other growth years. Results of targeted metabolomics profiling of 19 phenolic metabolites showed that the C6C1-type compounds accumulated in 9-year-old plants, the C6C3-type in 3-year-old plants, and the C6C3C6-type in 5-year-old plants. The stems had the greatest accumulations of the phenolic metabolites. C6C1 and C6C3-type metabolites are the most abundant in both roots and stems. in conclusion, the active compounds and pharmacological effects of A. senticosus in different growth years are different. The best harvest age for A. senticosus roots and stems was 5 years. The accumulation of 19 phenolic metabolites in different growth years also showed significant differences.

In patients with NSTI, circulating metabolites may serve as a substrate having impact on bacterial adaptation at the site of infection. Metabolic signatures associated with NSTI may reveal the potential to be useful as diagnostic and prognostic markers and novel targets for therapy. This study used untargeted metabolomics analyses of plasma from NSTI patients (n = 34) and healthy (noninfected) controls (n = 24) to identify the metabolic signatures and connectivity patterns among metabolites associated with NSTI. Metabolite-metabolite association networks were employed to compare the metabolic profiles of NSTI patients and noninfected surgical controls. Out of 97 metabolites detected, the abundance of 33 was significantly altered in NSTI patients. Analysis of metabolite-metabolite association networks showed a more densely connected network: specifically, 20 metabolites differentially connected between NSTI and controls. A selected set of significantly altered metabolites was tested in vitro to investigate potential influence on NSTI group A streptococcal strain growth and biofilm formation. Using chemically defined media supplemented with the selected metabolites, ornithine, ribose, urea, and glucuronic acid, revealed metabolite-specific effects on both bacterial growth and biofilm formation. This study identifies for the first time an NSTI-specific metabolic signature with implications for optimized diagnostics and therapies.

Yet, its etiology is not fully defined. In a previous study, we have shown that hypoxia and the activation of its upstream mediators (AKT/PI3K/mTOR) played a key role in WB myopathy, and supplementation of quantum blue (QB) can help to reduce WB severity via modulation of hypoxia-related pathways. To gain further insights, we undertook here a metabolomics approach to identify key metabolite signatures and outline their most enriched biological functions. Ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS) identified a total of 108 known metabolites. Of these, mean intensity differences atP< 0.05 were found in 60 metabolites with 42 higher and 18 lower in WB-affected compared to unaffected muscles. Multivariate analysis and Partial Least Squares Discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) scores plot displayed different clusters when comparing metabolites profile from affected and unaffected tissues and from moderate (MOD) and severe (SEV) WB muscles indicating that unique metabolite profiles are present for the WB-affected and unaffected muscles. To gain biologically related molecule networks, a stringent pathway analyses was conducted using IPA knowledge-base. The top 10 canonical pathways generated, using a fold-change -1.5 and 1.5 cutoff, with the 50 differentially abundant-metabolites were purine nucleotide degradation andde novobiosynthesis, sirtuin signaling pathway, citrulline-nitric oxide cycle, salvage pathways of pyrimidine DNA, IL-1 signaling, iNOS, Angiogenesis, PI3K/AKT signaling, and oxidative phosphorylation. The top altered bio-functions in term of molecular and cellular functions in WB-affected tissues included cellular development, cellular growth and proliferation, cellular death and survival, small molecular biochemistry, inflammatory response, free radical scavenging, cell signaling and cell-to-cell interaction, cell cycles, and lipid, carbohydrate, amino acid, and nucleic acid metabolisms. The top disorder functions identified were organismal injury and abnormalities, cancer, skeletal and muscular disorders, connective tissue disorders, and inflammatory diseases. Breast tissues from birds fed with high dose (2,000 FTU) of QB phytase exhibited 22 metabolites with significantly different levels compared to the control group with a clear cluster using PLS-DA analysis. Of these 22 metabolites, 9 were differentially abundant between WB-affected and unaffected muscles. Taken together, this study determined many metabolic signatures and disordered pathways, which could be regarded as new routes for discovering potential mechanisms of WB myopathy.

The main aim of this work was to explore the biochemical mechanisms involved in the improved growth performance of antibiotics and their alternatives in animal production. The results showed that both PEO and VIRG treatment significantly increased the relative abundance of phyla Bacteroidetes and decreased the abundance of phyla Firmicutes and genus of Lactobacillus in cecal microbiota of chickens. Compared to the control group (CT group), the relative abundance of genus of Alistipes, unclassified Rikenellaceae, Roseburia, and Anaeroplasma was enriched in the PEO group; that of genus Bacteroides, Lachnospiraceae, and unclassified Enterobacteriaceae was enriched in the cecal microbiota of the VIRG group. Untargeted metabolomics analyses revealed that the PEO treatment modified 102 metabolites and 3 KEGG pathways (primary bile acid biosynthesis and phenylalanine metabolism) in the cecal microbiota, and 81 metabolites and relevant KEGG pathways (fructose and mannose metabolism, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, and linoleic acid.) in the serum of the chicken. Compared to the CT group, VIRG treatment group differed 217 metabolites and 10 KEGG pathways in cecal contents and 142 metabolites and 7 KEGG pathways in serum of chickens. Pearson's correlation analysis showed that phyla Bacteroidetes and genus of Bacteroides, Alistipes, and unclassified Rikenellaceae (in the VIRG and PE group) were positively correlated with many lipid metabolites. However, phyla Firmicutes and genera Lactobacillus (higher in the CT group) were negatively correlated with the lipid and thymine metabolism, and positively correlated with hydroxyisocaproic acid, cytosine, and taurine. This study shows that dietary supplementation with PEO and VIRG altered the composition and metabolism profile of the cecal microbiota, modified the serum metabolism profile.

In the current study, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) coupled with multivariate analysis was applied to characterize the chemical composition of QZT and investigate the effect of QZT processing on its metabolic profile and sensory quality. The contents of polyphenols and flavonoids decreased significantly while the polysaccharides content remained stable, while the theabrownin content inversely increased during QZT processing. LC-MS-based metabolomics analyses revealed that the tea sample after microbial fermentation (MFT) was dramatically different from the sample before microbial fermentation (UFT), while MFT was very similar to QZT. A total of 102 compounds were identified as critical metabolites responsible for metabolic changes caused by QZT processing, with the contents of catechins and flavonoids significantly decreased, and some novel phenolic acids and catechin derivatives were formed. The sensory quality of QZT was mainly formed during microbial fermentation, which greatly reduced the astringency and bitterness of raw tea leaves and produced its characteristic woody and stale aroma as well as mellow taste. These results suggested that microbial fermentation is the critical process in changing the metabolic profile of raw tea leaves and forming the sensory quality of QZT.

Cell-Type-Specific Metabolic Profiling Achieved by Combining Desorption Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry Imaging and Immunofluorescence Staining	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							SUBCELLULAR SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; SINGLE CELLS; TISSUE; ION; ADENOSINE; ASTROCYTES; LIPIDS; SIMS	Cell-type-specific metabolic profiling in tissue with heterogeneous composition has been of great interest across all mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) technologies. We report here a powerful new chemical imaging capability in desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) MSI, which enables cell-type-specific and in situ metabolic profiling in complex tissue samples. We accomplish this by combining DESI-MSI with immunofluorescence staining using specific cell-type markers. We take advantage of the variable frequency of each distinct cell type in the lateral septal nucleus (LSN) region of mouse forebrain. This allows computational deconvolution of the cell-type-specific metabolic profile in neurons and astrocytes by convex optimization-a machine learning method. Based on our approach, we observed 107 metabolites that show different distributions and intensities between astrocytes and neurons. We subsequently identified 23 metabolites using high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem MS, which include small metabolites such as adenosine and N-acetylaspartate previously associated with astrocytes and neurons, respectively, as well as accumulation of several phospholipid species in neurons which have not been studied before. Overall, this method overcomes the relatively low spatial resolution of DESI-MSI and provides a new platform for in situ metabolic investigation at the cell-type level in complex tissue samples with heterogeneous cell-type composition.

Metabolic profiling in conditions of overweight and obesity in pregnancy could potentially be applied to elucidate the molecular basis of the adverse effects of gestational weight gain (GWG) and postpartum weight loss (WL) on future risks for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other chronic diseases. Methods: Biofluid samples were collected from 114 ethnically diverse pregnant women with body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 40 kg/m(2) from Chicago (US), as part of a randomized lifestyle intervention trial (Maternal Offspring Metabolics: Family Intervention Trial; NCT01631747). At 15 weeks, 35 weeks of gestation, and at 1 year postpartum, the blood plasma lipidome and metabolic profile of urine samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 NMR) respectively. Results: Urinary 4-deoxyerythronic acid and 4-deoxythreonic acid were found to be positively correlated to BMI. Seventeen plasma lipids were found to be associated with GWG and 16 lipids were found to be associated with WL, which included phosphatidylinositols (PI), phosphatidylcholines (PC), lysophospholipids (lyso-), sphingomyelins (SM) and ether phosphatidylcholine (PC-O). Three phospholipids found to be positively associated with GWG all contained palmitate side-chains, and amongst the 14 lipids that were negatively associated with GWG, seven were PC-O. Six of eight lipids found to be negatively associated with WL contained an 18:2 fatty acid side-chain. Conclusions: Maternal obesity was associated with characteristic urine and plasma metabolic phenotypes, and phospholipid profile was found to be associated with both GWG and postpartum WL in metabolically healthy pregnant women with overweight/obesity. Postpartum WL may be linked to the reduction in the intake of linoleic acid/conjugated linoleic acid food sources in our study population.

However, the mechanisms underlying endophyte-plant metabolic interactions are still poorly understood. Here, we analysed the effects of fungal endophytes on the metabolite profiles of grape cells from two cultivars: 'Cabernet Sauvignon' (CS) and 'Rose honey' (RH). Our results clearly showed that co-culture with endophytic fungi greatly modified the metabolic profiles in grape cells of both varieties. Treatments with endophytic fungal strains caused the numbers of detected metabolites to vary from 10 to 19 in CS cells and from 8 to 14 in RH cells. In addition, 5 metabolites were detected in all CS cell samples, while 4 metabolites were detected in all RH cell samples. Some endophytic fungal strains could even introduce novel metabolites into the co-cultured grape cells. The metabolic profiles of grape leaves shaped by endophytic fungi exhibited host selectivity and fungal strain specificity. In this assay, the fungal strains RH32 (Alternaria sp.) and MDR36 (Colletotrichum sp.) triggered an increased response of the detected metabolites, including the greatest increase in the metabolite contents in grape cells of both cultivars. No obvious effects in terms of metabolite numbers and contents in grape cells when co-cultured with fungal strains RH7 (Epicoccum sp.) and RH48 (Colletotrichum sp.) were observed. The results of this experiment suggest that endophytic fungi could be used to control the metabolic profiles of grapes and thus increase grape quality.

Determination of the metabolism of ribociclib is required during the drug development stage. In this study, metabolic profiles of ribociclib were investigated using rat and human liver microsomes. Metabolites were structurally identified by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry operated in positive-ion mode. The metabolites were characterized by accurate masses, MS2 spectra and retention times. With rat and human liver microsomes, a total of 10 metabolites were detected and further identified. No human-specific metabolites were detected. The metabolic pathways of ribociclib were oxygenation, demethylation and dealkylation. Most importantly, two glutathione (GSH) adducts were identified in human liver microsomes fortified with GSH. The formation of the GSH adducts was hypothesized to be through the oxidation of electron-rich 1,4-benzenediamine to a 1,4-diiminoquinone intermediate, which is highly reactive and can be trapped by GSH to form stable metabolites. The current study provides an overview of the metabolic profiles of ribociclib in vitro, which will be of great help in understanding the efficacy and toxicity of this drug.

Its seed, containing a particularly high oil content, are widely studied for their biodiesel properties by nutritional components and oil body ultrastructure. However, their comprehensive biochemical compositions have not been studied. Methods: During S. tonkinensis kernel development, we collected samples from four time points for metabolite profiling and classification through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results: A total of 187 and 1556 metabolites were obtained, respectively. All of the metabolites were grouped into 19 and 21 classes by their chemical properties and into 8 clusters based on their change trends, respectively. Among all the metabolites, carboxylic acids and derivatives, flavonoids, fatty acyls, glycerophospholipids, organooxygen compounds, prenol lipids, and steroids and steroid derivatives were the main components. Alanine, glutamine, tryptophan, tyrosine and valine were the five most abundant amino acids. Palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid and linoleic acid were the four major free fatty acids. Flavans, flavonoid glycosides and o-methylated flavonoids were the three major flavonoids. The differential metabolites distributions between different time points were identified. A pathway enrichment was performed, which was mainly focused on three groups, amino acids metabolism, carbon flow from sucrose to lipid and secondary metabolites biosynthesis. Conclusions: It's the first time to analyze the metabolite fingerprinting for developing S. tonkinensis kernels and identify varied kinds of flavonoids. We performed metabolite profiling, classification and pathway enrichment to assess the comprehensive biochemical compositions. Our results described the change in major metabolites and main metabolic processes during S. tonkinensis kernel development and provided a variety of bases for seed applications as biofuel or medicine.

Six Holstein Friesian crossbred bulls (three high-fertile and three low-fertile bulls) were the experimental animals. Sperm proteins were isolated and protein-normalized samples were processed for metabolite extraction and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. Mass spectrometry data were processed using iMETQ software and metabolites were identified using Human Metabolome DataBase while, Metaboanalyst 4.0 tool was used for statistical and pathway analysis. A total of 3,704 metabolites belonging to various chemical classes were identified in bull spermatozoa. After sorting out exogenous metabolites, 56 metabolites were observed common to both the groups while 44 and 35 metabolites were found unique to high- and low-fertile spermatozoa, respectively. Among the common metabolites, concentrations of 19 metabolites were higher in high-fertile compared to low-fertile spermatozoa (fold change > 1.00). Spermatozoa metabolites with variable importance in projections score of more than 1.5 included hypotaurine, d-cysteine, selenocystine. In addition, metabolites such as spermine and l-cysteine were identified exclusively in high-fertile spermatozoa. Collectively, the present study established the metabolic profile of bovine spermatozoa and identified the metabolomic differences between spermatozoa from high- and low-fertile bulls. Among the sperm metabolites, hypotaurine, selenocysteine, l-malic acid, d-cysteine, and chondroitin 4-sulfate hold the potential to be recognized as fertility-associated metabolites.

Characterisation of the Serum Metabolic Signature of Cholangiocarcinoma in a United Kingdom Cohort	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL HEPATOLOGY			English	Article						mass spectroscopy; cholangiocarcinoma; metabolic finger print; metabolomics; diagnostic biomarkers	MAGNETIC-RESONANCE-SPECTROSCOPY; PRIMARY BILIARY-CIRRHOSIS; BILE; LYSOPHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE; PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE; MUTATIONS	Background: A distinct serum metabonomic pattern has been previously revealed to be associated with various forms of liver disease. Here, we aimed to apply mass spectrometry to obtain serum metabolomic profiles from individuals with cholangiocarcinoma and benign hepatobiliary diseases to gain an insight into pathogenesis and search for potential early-disease biomarkers. Methods: Serum samples were profiled using a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography platform, coupled to a mass spectrometer. A total of 47 serum specimens from 8 cholangiocarcinoma cases, 20 healthy controls, 8 benign disease controls (bile duct strictures) and 11 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (as malignant disease controls) were included. Data analysis was performed using univariate and multivariate statistics. Results: The serum metabolome disparities between the metabolite profiles from healthy controls and patients with hepatobiliary disease were predominantly related to changes in lipid and lipid-derived compounds (phospholipids, bile acids and steroids) and amino acid metabolites (phenylalanine). A metabolic pattern indicative of inflammatory response due to cirrhosis and cholestasis was associated with the disease groups. The abundance of phospholipid metabolites was altered in individuals with liver disease, particularly cholangiocarcinoma, but no significant difference was seen between profiles from patients with benign biliary strictures and cholangiocarcinoma. Conclusion: The serum metabolome in cholangiocarcinoma exhibited changes in metabolites related to inflammation, altered energy production and phospholipid metabolism. This study serves to highlight future avenues for biomarker research in large-scale studies.	[Alsaleh, Munirah; Leftley, Zoe; Barbera, Thomas A.; Koomson, Larry K.; Zabron, Abigail; Crossey, Mary M.

LEAF; PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; ANTIOXIDANT; BERRIES; SUGAR; PLANT; IDENTIFICATION; ACCLIMATION	Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) is increasingly cultivated to produce raw materials for food and nutraceuticals. There is little knowledge on composition of sea buckthorn leaves (SBLs) and the key factors influencing the composition. This research aims to unravel the metabolic profile of SBLs and the effects of cultivar, location and stage of growth, and climatic conditions on the metabolic profile of SBLs. Leaves of two sea buckthorn cultivars grown in the south and north of Finland during two consecutive growth seasons were studied using untargeted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics. The highest variance in the metabolic profile was linked to the growth stage, wherein leaves from the first 7 weeks of harvest were characterized with higher abundance of polyphenols, while relatively higher abundance of carbohydrates and sugars was observed in the later weeks. The growth location attributed for the second highest variation, wherein the north-south comparison identified fatty acids and sugars as discriminatory metabolites, and the potential association of metabolome to natural abiotic stressors was revealed. An inverse correlation between carbohydrate/sugar content as well as fatty acids of higher carbon chain length with the temperature variables was evident. The supervised chemometric models with high sensitivity and specificity classified and predicted the samples based on growth stage and location, and cultivar. Nontargeted NMR-metabolomics revealed the metabolic profile of SBLs and their variation associated with various biotic and abiotic factors. Cultivar and growth stage are key factors to consider when harvesting SBLs for use in food and nutraceuticals. Practical Application Globally, sea buckthorn cultivation has been rapidly increasing due to the known health-promoting benefits of the berries and leaves of the plant. The current research obtained new comprehensive information on the compositional profile of sea buckthorn leaves as well as the impact of major contributory factors, such as cultivars, the advancement of growth stage, geographical location, and weather parameters. The findings of this research provide new knowledge and guidance for plant breeding, cultivation and commercial utilization of sea buckthorn leaves as raw materials for food, feed, and nutraceuticals.

Despite extensive efforts to identify key metabolites triggered by complete submergence of rice possessing SUBMERGENCE 1 (SUB1) locus, metabolic responses of internode elongation of deepwater rice governed by the SNORKEL 1 and 2 genes remain elusive. This study investigated specific metabolomic responses under partial submergence (PS) to deepwater- (C9285) and non-deepwater rice cultivars (Taichung 65 (T65)). In addition, we examined the response in a near-isogenic line (NIL-12) that has a C9285 genomic fragment on chromosome 12 introgressed into the genetic background of T65. Under short-term submergence (0-24 h), metabolite profiles of C9285, NIL-12, and T65 were compared to extract significantly changed metabolites in deepwater rice under PS conditions. Comprehensive metabolite and phytohormone profiling revealed increases in metabolite levels in the glycolysis pathway in NIL-12 plants. Under long-term submergence (0-288 h), we found decreased amino acid levels. These metabolomic changes were opposite when compared to those in flood-tolerant rice with SUB1 locus. Auxin conjugate levels related to stress response decreased in NIL-12 lines relative to T65. Our analysis helped clarify the complex metabolic reprogramming in deepwater rice as an escape strategy.

Relationship between energy balance and metabolic profiles in plasma and milk of dairy cows in early lactation	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article						metabolomics; mammary gland; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; nuclear magnetic resonance	RUMEN-PROTECTED CHOLINE; NUCLEAR-MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; DRY PERIOD LENGTH; AMINO-ACIDS; STATISTICAL HETEROSPECTROSCOPY; NUTRIENT METABOLISM; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; FATTY LIVER; GLUCOSE; MAMMARY	Negative energy balance in dairy cows in early lactation is related to alteration of metabolic status. However, the relationships among energy balance, metabolic profile in plasma, and metabolic profile in milk have not been reported. In this study our aims were: (1) to reveal the metabolic profiles of plasma and milk by integrating results from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with data from liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS); and (2) to investigate the relationship between energy balance and the metabolic profiles of plasma and milk. For this study 24 individual dairy cows (parity 2.5 +/- 0.5; mean +/- standard deviation) were studied in lactation wk 2. Body weight (mean +/- standard deviation; 627.4 +/- 56.4 kg) and milk yield (28.1 +/- 6.7 kg/d; mean +/- standard deviation) were monitored daily. Milk composition (fat, protein, and lactose) and net energy balance were calculated. Plasma and milk samples were collected and analyzed using LC-MS and NMR. From all plasma metabolites measured, 27 were correlated with energy balance. These plasma metabolites were related to body reserve mobilization from body fat, muscle, and bone; increased blood flow; and gluconeogenesis. From all milk metabolites measured, 30 were correlated with energy balance. These milk metabolites were related to cell apoptosis and cell proliferation. Nine metabolites detected in both plasma and milk were correlated with each other and with energy balance. These metabolites were mainly related to hyperketonemia; beta-oxidation of fatty acids; and one-carbon metabolism. The metabolic profiles of plasma and milk provide an in-depth insight into the physiological pathways of dairy cows in negative energy balance in early lactation. In addition to the classical indicators for energy balance (e.g., beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetone, and glucose), the current study presents some new metabolites (e.g., glycine in plasma and milk; kynurenine, panthothenate, or arginine in plasma) in lactating dairy cows that are related to energy balance and may be of interest as new indicators for energy balance.

Therefore, growth parameters can be significantly influenced. Two recombinant strains, previously developed by the multiple delta-integration of a glucoamylase in the industrial Saccharomyces cerevisiae 27P, did not display any detectable metabolic burden. In this study, a Fourier Transform InfraRed Spectroscopy (FTIR)-based assay was employed to investigate the effect of delta-integration on yeast strains' tolerance to the increasing ethanol levels typical of the starch-to-ethanol industry. FTIR fingerprint, indeed, offers a holistic view of the metabolome and is a well-established method to assess the stress response of microorganisms. Cell viability and metabolomic fingerprints have been considered as parameters to detecting any physiological and/or metabolomic perturbations. Quite surprisingly, the three strains did not show any difference in cell viability but metabolomic profiles were significantly altered and different when the strains were incubated both with and without ethanol. A LC/MS untargeted workflow was applied to assess the metabolites and pathways mostly involved in these strain-specific ethanol responses, further confirming the FTIR fingerprinting of the parental and recombinant strains. These results indicated that the multiple delta-integration prompted huge metabolomic changes in response to short-term ethanol exposure, calling for deeper metabolomic and genomic insights to understand how and, to what extent, genetic engineering could affect the yeast metabolome.

Fifty-one infants who were hospitalized during an initial episode of severe RSV bronchiolitis at 6 months of age or less were included and followed for up to the age of 3 years. Of them, 24 developed subsequent recurrent wheezing and 27 did not. Untargeted serum metabolomics was performed by ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Cytokines were measured by multiplex immunoassay. Difference in serum metabolomic profiles was observed between infants who developed recurrent wheezing and those who did not. L-lactic acid level was significantly higher in infants with recurrent wheezing than those without. Pyrimidine metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and arginine biosynthesis were identified as the most significant changed pathways between the two groups.

This exploratory study showed that differential serum metabolic signatures during severe RSV bronchiolitis in early infancy were associated with the development of subsequent recurrent wheezing in later childhood.

Here, the contributions of polyphenols were assessed through targeted metabolic profiling using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 86 polyphenols were identified from 47 green tea samples with varying astringency scores, of which 76 compounds were relatively quantified. A correlation matrix analysis revealed that monohydroxyflavonol and acyl derivatives of polyphenols, except for galloylated catechins, had negative correlations with the other polyphenols. Principal component analysis revealed a distinct separation of monohydroxyflavonol and acyl derivatives of polyphenols from the other polyphenols. The results suggest metabolic differences in terms of hydroxylation, glycosylation, acylation, and condensation reactions of polyphenols between the different tea samples, particularly between the samples obtained in spring and autumn. The correlation analysis showed that metabolic fluxes toward the aforementioned four reactions of polyphenols played unique roles in the astringency of tea infusions.

Male mice (n= 15) at the age of 12 weeks were used: BALB/c (n= 5), C57BL/6 (n= 5) and CD1 (n= 5). Solid phase microextraction (SPME) was applied for the extraction of analytes from the tissues. SPME fibers (approximately 0.2 mm in diameter) coated with a biocompatible sorbent (4 mm length of hydrophilic-lipophilic balanced particles) were inserted into each organ immediately after euthanasia. Samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled to a Q-Exactive Focus Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Distinct interstrain differences in the metabolomic patterns of brain and liver tissue were revealed. The metabolome of kidney and muscle tissue in BALB/c mice differed greatly from C57BL/6 and CD1 strains. The main compounds differentiating all the targeted organs were alpha-amino acids, purine nucleotides and fatty acid esters. The results of the study indicate that the baseline metabolome of organs, as well as different metabolic pathways, vary widely among general-purpose models of laboratory mice commonly used in biomedical research.

In addition, perilla and sesame seeds are rich sources of health-promoting compounds, such as fatty acids, tocopherols, phytosterols and policosanols. Thus, developing a method to determine the geographic origin of these seeds is important for ensuring authenticity, safety and traceability and to prevent cheating. We aimed to develop a discriminatory predictive model for determining the geographic origin of perilla and sesame seeds using comprehensive metabolite profiling coupled with chemometrics. The orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis models were well established with good validation values (Q(2)=0.761 to 0.799). Perilla and sesame seed samples used in this study showed a clear separation between Korea and China as geographic origins in our predictive models. We found that glycolic acid could be a potential biomarker for perilla seeds and proline and glycine for sesame seeds. Our findings provide a comprehensive quality assessment of perilla and sesame seeds. We believe that our models can be used for regional authentication of perilla and sesame seeds cultivated in diverse geographic regions.

However, HCQ induced retinal toxicity, which might result in irreversible retinopathy, is one of the most important complications of HCQ. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the HCQ retinal toxicity is still not well known. Retinal pigment epithelium, in which HCQ is highly enriched due to the tissue-specific affinity of HCQ, is considered to play important role in HCQ retinopathy. Herein, we used a metabolomics approach based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to investigate the metabolic changes in retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19) with HCQ exposure at 6 h and 24 h. ARPE-19 cells were treated with HCQ at sub-lethal concentration 20 (IC 20), which was determined with MTT assay. Untargeted metabolic profiling revealed 9 and 15 metabolites that were significantly different between control group and HCQ exposure group at 6 h and 24 h, respectively. Enrichment and pathway analysis highlighted ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, D-Glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism and C5-Branched dibasic acid metabolism were disturbed after HCQ exposure. These findings increased our knowledge about the metabolic perturbation induced by HCQ exposure and indicated that metabolic profiling in the ARPE-19 cells might be helpful in understanding the mechanism of HCQ retinal toxicity and exploring potential biomarker.

However, the metabolic profiles remain unknown. This study was carried out to investigate the metabolic profiles of lusianthridin in liver microsomes. Lusianthridin was co-incubated with liver microsomes in the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and UDP-glucuronic acid or glutathione at 37 degrees C for 1 h. The incubation samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography combined with electrospray ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry. The data were acquired and processed. The structures of the metabolites were proposed by comparing their accurate mass and MS2 spectra with those of the parent compound. A total of 15 metabolites were detected in vitro, including two phase I and 13 phase II metabolites. The phase I metabolic pathways were oxidation, demethylation and dehydrogenation. The phase II metabolic pathways referred to glucuronidation and glutathione conjugation. The present study provides an overview pertaining to the metabolic profiles of lusianthridin in vitro, which is indispensable for understanding the efficacy and safety of lusianthridin, as well as the herbal medicine D. venustum.

However, thein vivobiotransformation ofRhizoma coptidisis still unclear to date. In this study, a three-step strategy using UPLC-Q-TOF/MS was applied to clarify thein vivoabsorbed constituents and metabolites in rats after oral administration ofRhizoma coptidis.First, alkaloids inRhizoma coptidisextract were identified. Second, six abundant alkaloids (berberine, palmatine, coptisine, epiberberine, jatrorrhizine, and columbamine) were selected as representative prototypes and the metabolic fates of them in rats were investigated to obtain a database ofRhizoma coptidis-derived metabolites. Finally, the metabolic profiles ofRhizoma coptidiswere fully elucidated based on the above-mentioned results. In summary, 29 alkaloids were identified inRhizoma coptidis, and a database ofRhizoma coptidis-derived metabolites was obtained with 144 characterized metabolites. A total of 89 xenobiotics including 12 absorbed constituents and 77 metabolites were identified in dosed rat biosamples.

The aim of the present study was to compare the metabolic profile of pomegranate ecotypes from different geographical origins of Iran, the largest producer of pomegranates in the world. (1) H-NMR and 2D NMR spectroscopy were applied to investigate the ecotypic variation. Multivariate data analyses were used to identify overall metabolic differences. Mazandaran pomegranate samples were found to be different from the other ecotypes, having a high content of citric and succinic acids. Bajestan, Ferdows, and Yazd pomegranates contained comparatively higher amounts of anthocyanins and ellagic acid derivatives than other pomegranate ecotypes. The distribution of metabolites among different ecotypes of pomegranate is discussed on the basis of these findings.

The main method to evaluate the effect of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in the locally advanced stage is imaging which cannot meet the clinical needs. This study aimed to explore potential cervical cancer biomarkers via plasma metabolomics and evaluate the effectiveness of CCRT and disease progression. Methods: Twenty-four primary and thirty recurrent patients were enrolled between November 2016 and November 2017. Plasma samples were obtained by centrifugation of whole blood collected from enrolled patients at admission and from primary patients after CCRT. Plasma metabolic profiles were determined via ultra-performance liquid chromatography with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Multivariate analyses and public databases were used to screen and identify differential metabolites. Pathway analysis was conducted using MetaboAnalyst. Results: Metabolic profiles obtained were significantly different among primary, post-CCRT-treated, and recurrent patients. Multivariate analyses showed that 37 metabolites differed significantly among the three groups, of which the levels of 22 metabolites changed significantly after CCRT and recovered or even exceeded the levels in primary patients when the tumor reappeared. These 22 metabolites were mainly lipids involved in sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Among them, 8 metabolites with area under curve values above 0.75 between each pair of groups exhibited great potential for evaluating CCRT effectiveness and disease progression. Conclusions: Our results show significantly different plasma metabolic profiles among the three cervical cancer groups; 8 metabolites were identified as potential biomarkers to evaluate the effectiveness of CCRT and disease progression, which can help evaluate the prognosis and treatment of cervical cancer in a timely manner.

Upregulated activity of RR plays an active role in tumor progression. As the regulatory subunit of RR, ribonucleotide reductase subunit M2 (RRM2) is regarded as one of the effective therapeutic targets for DNA replication-dependent diseases, such as cancers. Recent studies have revealed that osalmid significantly inhibits the activity of RRM2, but the metabolic profile of osalmid remains unknown. Objective: The aim of this study was to clarify the metabolic profile including metabolites, isoenzymes and metabolic pathways of osalmid. The anti-human hepatocellular carcinoma activity and mechanism of metabolites were further investigated. Materials and methods: Ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF-MS) was used for identifying metabolites and for characterizing phase I and phase II metabolic pathways with recombinant enzymes or in human liver microsomes of osalmid. The eHiTS docking system was used for potential RRM2 inhibitor screening among metabolites. Cytotoxicity assays were performed for evaluating cell proliferation inhibitory activity of metabolites. Cell cycle assays and cell apoptosis assays were assessed by flow cytometry. Western blotting analysis of RRM2, cyclin D1, p21, p53, phosphorylated p53, Bcl-2 and Bax was performed to explore the anti-hepatocellular carcinoma mechanism of the active metabolites. Results: Ten metabolites of osalmid were identified, and none of them have been reported previously. Hydroxylation, glucuronidation, sulfonation, acetylation and degradation were recognized as the main metabolic processes of osalmid. Isozymes of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, UGT1A1, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT2B7 and UGT2B15 were involved in phase I and phase II metabolism of osalmid. Metabolites M7, M8 and M10 showed higher binding affinities with the RRM2 active site than osalmid. Metabolite M7 exhibited potent inhibitory activity to hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines by both competitive inhibition and down-regulation of RRM2. Moreover, M7 significantly induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by activating p53-related pathways. Conclusions: The metabolic profile of osalmid was identified. M7 significantly inhibited human hepatocellular carcinoma progression by inhibiting RRM2 activity. Furthermore, M7 induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by activating p53-related signaling pathways.

The current study employed novel metabolic profiling approaches to quantify key secondary metabolites including phytoestrogens to better understand their biosynthetic regulation in a range of field-grown annual pasture legumes. In addition, total polyphenol and proanthocyanidins were quantified using Folin-Ciocalteu and vanillin assays, respectively. Metabolic profiling coupled with biochemical assay results demonstrated marked differences in the abundance of coumestans, flavonoids, polyphenols, and proanthocyanidins in annual pasture legume species. Genetically related pasture legumes segregated similarly from a chemotaxonomic perspective. A strong and positive association was observed between the concentration of phytoestrogens and upregulation of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in annual pasture legumes. Our findings suggest that evolutionary differences in metabolic dynamics and biosynthetic regulation of secondary metabolites have logically occurred over time in various species of annual pasture legumes resulting in enhanced plant defense.

Laowo ham (LWH) is an example of an indigenous fermented food from Southwestern China that has cultural, ecological, economic, and health significance to local communities. We carried out ethnobiological surveys coupled with metagenomic and metabolomic analyses using GC-TOF-MS and UPLC-QTOF-MS to elucidate the microbiota and metabolic profiles of LWH samples at different ripening stages. The results from high-throughput sequencing showed a total of 502 bacterial genera in LWH samples with 12 genera of bacteria and 6 genera of fungi identified as dominant groups. This is the first study to our knowledge to report the bacteria of Lentibacillus and Mesorhizobium along with fungi Eremascus and Xerochrysium on a fermented meat product. Findings further revealed that the metabolite profiles among LWH samples were significantly different. In total, 27 and 30 metabolites from GC-TOF-MS and UPLC-QTOF-MS analysis, respectively, were annotated as highly discriminative metabolites. Among the differential compounds, the relative contents of most amino acids showed the highest in the LWH sample ripened for two years, while some metabolites with potential therapeutic effects such as levetiracetam were the most abundant in the LWH sample ripened for three years. The correlation analysis indicated that the dominant microbes were closely related to differential metabolites, highlighting the importance of their functional characterization. Findings indicate that the consumption of LWH contributes to microbiological and chemical diversity of human diets as well as suggests efficacy of combining GC-MS and LC-MS to study the metabolites in dry-cured meat products.

Integrated RNA and metabolite profiling of urine liquid biopsies for prostate cancer biomarker discovery	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							GLUTAMINE-METABOLISM; BLADDER-CANCER; MARKERS; METABOLOMICS; SARCOSINE; IDENTIFICATION; CARCINOMA; DIAGNOSIS; SAMPLES; GENOME	Sensitive and specific diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for prostate cancer (PCa) are urgently needed. Urine samples are a non-invasive means to obtain abundant and readily accessible "liquid biopsies". Herein we used urine liquid biopsies to identify and characterize a novel group of urine-enriched RNAs and metabolites in patients with PCa and normal individuals with or without benign prostatic disease. Differentially expressed RNAs were identified in urine samples by deep sequencing and metabolites in urine were measured by mass spectrometry. mRNA and metabolite profiles were distinct in patients with benign and malignant disease. Integrated analysis of urinary gene expression and metabolite signatures unveiled an aberrant glutamate metabolism and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle node in prostate cancer-derived cells. Functional validation supported a role for glutamate metabolism and glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 1 (GOT1)-dependent redox balance in PCa, which could be exploited for novel biomarkers and therapies. In this study, we discovered cancer-specific changes in urinary RNAs and metabolites, paving the way for the development of sensitive and specific urinary PCa diagnostic biomarkers either alone or in combination. Our methodology was based on single void urine samples (i.e., without prostatic massage). The integrated analysis of metabolomic and transcriptomic data from these liquid biopsies revealed a glutamate metabolism and tricarboxylic acid cycle node that was specific to prostate-derived cancer cells and cancer-specific metabolic changes in urine.

This study aimed to distinguish the O. japonicas samples from Zhejiang and Sichuan by using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLCR-TOF MS)-based metabolome analysis. Firstly, a global chemical constituent identification of O. japonicas was carried out by using both automatic and manual methods. An integrated steroidal saponins structural identification strategy in O. japonicas based on exact mass information, fragmentation characteristics and retention time was developed. Overall, 135 steroidal saponins, 47 homoisoflavonoids and 9 other metabolites were quickly identified or tentatively identified from the MSE continuum data. Furthermore, multivariate statistical analysis revealed that O. japonicas from Zhejiang and Sichuan can clearly be separated and some markers were screened. Moreover, some major active components including total soluble sugar, total soluble polyphenol, total flavonoid, total saponin and 10 specific compounds were analyzed quantitatively. In general, these results showed that there were many differences between the metabolic profile data of O. japonicas from different producing areas, O. japonicas from Sichuan showed higher level steroidal saponins and samples from Zhejiang had higher contents of homoisoflavonoids specifically, and indicated that metabolite profiling by UPLCR-TOF MS is an effective approach for the discrimination of medicinal herbs from different geographical origins.

In particular, biofilm-forming bacteria are hard to eradicate, and alternative methods of treatment based on covering wounds with vascularized flaps of tissue are being developed. The greater omentum is a complex organ covering the intestines in the abdomen, which support wound recovery following surgical procedures and exhibit natural antimicrobial activity that could improve biofilm eradication. We investigated changes in rats' metabolome following Klebsiella pneumoniae infections, as well as the greater omentum's ability for Klebsiella pneumoniae biofilm eradication. Rats received either sterile implants or implants covered with Klebsiella pneumoniae biofilm (placed in the peritoneum or greater omentum). Metabolic profiles were monitored at days 0, 2, and 5 after surgery using combined proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) and high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) measurements of urine samples followed by chemometric analysis. Obtained results indicated that grafting of the sterile implant to the greater omentum did not cause major disturbances in rats' metabolism, whereas the sterile implant located in the peritoneum triggered metabolic perturbations related to tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, as well as choline, tryptophan, and hippurate metabolism. Presence of implants colonized with Klebsiella pneumoniae biofilm resulted in similar levels of metabolic perturbations in both locations. Our findings confirmed that surgical procedures utilizing the greater omentum may have a practical use in wound healing and tissue regeneration in the future.

Quantitative as well as qualitative differences in metabolite profiles of red, black and white rice were observed. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the data obtained from semi-targeted metabolite profiling showed a clear separation of grains with different pericarp colour. In the PCA scores plot, PC1 separated pigmented rice and non-pigmented rice. While, PC2 separated red rice and black rice. Biplot generated from metabolite profile of the rice grains indicated that vanillic acid, protocatechuic acid and glycerol-3-phosphate differentiate black rice from red and white rice. Erythritol and ribonic acid are present only in red rice causing its separation from black and white rice. Additionally, total phenolic content (TPC), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2 '-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonicacid) (ABTS) and the reducing potential of extracts in terms of ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) were carried out. DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activities of pigmented rice are higher than that of white rice, possibly due to the presence of high TPC in their grains. However, reducing power in terms of FRAP is highest in black rice and is comparable in red and white rice. Furthermore, correlation analysis of antioxidant activities with the metabolites was done to identify the possible primary metabolites contributing to antioxidant capacities of pigmented and non-pigmented rice. This study provides a premise for integration of pigmented rice in our daily diet owing to the potential health benefits of the compositional metabolites.

The major glucosinolates and phenolic compounds in kale and daikon radish were measured. The urinary metabolome after feeding at different time periods was investigated. A targeted metabolite analysis method was developed based on the known metabolic pathways for glucosinolates and phenolic compounds. Using a targeted approach, a total of 18 metabolites were found in urine: 4 from phenolic compounds and 14 from glucosinolates. Among these metabolites, 4-methylsulfinyl-3-butenyl isothiocyanate, 4-methylsulfinyl-3-butenyl isothiocyanate-cysteine, and 4-methylsulfinyl-3-butenylglucosinolate-N-acetyl cysteine were reported for the first time in human urine. The combination of non-targeted and targeted metabolomic approaches can gain a full metabolite profile for human dietary intervention studies.

Despite extensive research in the field, reports comparing propolis from different geographical areas are still limited, compromising our current understanding of the potential therapeutic effect associated with propolis and its derived compounds. Herein, a comparative study between ChPs and BrGPs including their metabolite profile and bioactivities was performed. Interestingly, even when ChPs and BrGPs showed similar anti-inflammatory potential, our results showed that they contained very different levels of ethanol extract, total flavonoids and total phenolic acids and in fact, LC-MS metabolic profiling and pattern recognition could effectively distinguish ChPs and BrGPs. Moreover, all the propolis samples tested showed good anti-oxidant activity and no significant difference of free radical scavenging capacity existed between ChPs and BrGPs. In conclusion, ChPs and BrGPs have a distinct chemome, but their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities are similar.

Amniotic fluid is a biofluid with great potential for insights into the feto-maternal milieu. It is rich in metabolites, and metabolic consequences of inflammation is yet researched only to a limited extent. Metabolomic profiling provides opportunities to identify potential biomarkers of inflammatory conditioned pregnancy complications such as spontaneous preterm delivery. Objective:The aim of this study was to perform metabolomic profiling of amniotic fluid from uncomplicated singleton pregnancies in the mid-trimester to identify potential biomarkers associated with spontaneous preterm delivery and gestational duration at delivery. A secondary aim was to replicate previously reported mid-trimester amniotic fluid metabolic biomarkers of spontaneous preterm delivery in asymptomatic women. Method:A nested case-control study was performed within a larger cohort study of asymptomatic pregnant women undergoing mid-trimester genetic amniocentesis at 14-19 gestational weeks in Gothenburg, Sweden. Medical records were used to obtain clinical data and delivery outcome variables. Amniotic fluid samples from women with a subsequent spontaneous preterm delivery (n = 37) were matched with amniotic fluid samples from women with a subsequent spontaneous delivery at term (n = 37). Amniotic fluid samples underwent untargeted metabolomic analyses using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Multivariate random forest analyses were used for data processing. A secondary targeted analysis was performed, aiming to replicate previously reported mid-trimester amniotic fluid metabolic biomarkers in women with a subsequent spontaneous preterm delivery. Results:Multivariate analysis did not distinguish the samples from women with a subsequent spontaneous preterm delivery from those with a subsequent term delivery. Neither was the metabolic profile associated with gestational duration at delivery. Potential metabolic biomarker candidates were identified from four publications by two different research groups relating mid-trimester amniotic fluid metabolomes to spontaneous PTD, of which fifteen markers were included in the secondary analysis. None of these were replicated. Conclusions:Metabolomic profiles of early mid-trimester amniotic fluid were not associated with spontaneous preterm delivery or gestational duration at delivery in this cohort.

To determine the diagnostic capacity of this association, we compared stool microbiomes across 163 well-characterized participants encompassing non-NAFLD controls, NAFLD-cirrhosis patients, and their first-degree relatives. Interrogation of shotgun metagenomic and untargeted metabolomic profiles by using the random forest machine learning algorithm and differential abundance analysis identified discrete metagenomic and metabolomic signatures that were similarly effective in detecting cirrhosis (diagnostic accuracy 0.91, area under curve [AUC]). Combining the metagenomic signature with age and serum albumin levels accurately distinguished cirrhosis in etiologically and genetically distinct cohorts from geographically separated regions. Additional inclusion of serum aspartate aminotransferase levels, which are increased in cirrhosis patients, enabled discrimination of cirrhosis from earlier stages of fibrosis. These findings demonstrate that a core set of gut microbiome species might offer universal utility as a non-invasive diagnostic test for cirrhosis.

Metabolomic Differentials in Women With and Without Fibromyalgia	CTS-CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE			English	Article							AMINO-ACIDS; PLASMA; STABILITY; SERUM	A nontargeted plasma metabolomic analysis was conducted to compare differentially expressed metabolites in women with and without fibromyalgia (FM) using data and samples collected from two parent studies in women with FM (n = 20) and comparative data collected from newly recruited age-matched women (n = 20). Blood plasma samples were analyzed for metabolite content using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Consolidation of positive and negative ion mode metabolomics data with fold change (>2 or <0.5) and variable importance of projection scores >= 1 revealed statistically significant metabolites comparing samples from women with and without FM. Metabolite profiles in patients with FM differed from the comparison group in energy, lipid and amino acid metabolites reflecting heightened oxidative stress, inflammation, and tryptophan degradation in patients with FM. Study results may contribute to further identification of unique metabolomic profiles enhancing understanding of the pathophysiology of FM and for the development of effective therapeutic options.

To better understand the action of this constituent, it is necessary to study the metabolic profiles in different species. Methods For the metabolic stability study, senkyunolide A at a concentration of 0.5 mu M was individually incubated with hepatocytes of mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human at 37 degrees C for 2 h. For metabolite profiling and identification, senkyunolide A (10 mu M) was incubated with hepatocytes and the incubation samples were analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography combined with diode-array detector and high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC/DAD-HRMS). The identities of the metabolites were characterized by accurate masses, product ions and retention times. Results Senkyunolide A was metabolically unstable in hepatocytes. Thein vitrohalf-lives were 136.2, 60.6, 33.65, 55.96 and 138 min in mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human hepatocytes, respectively. Furthermore, a total of 14 metabolites were detected. M1 and M9 were the most abundant metabolites in all species. The metabolic pathways of senkyunolide A involved the following pathways: (1) hydroxylation to form 10- and 11-hydroxysenkyunolide A, which further underwent epoxidation followed by GSH conjugation; (2) epoxidation followed by epoxide hydrolysis or GSH conjugation; and (3) aromatization to form 3-butylphthalide followed by hydroxylation. Conclusions Hydroxylation, epoxidation, aromatization and GSH conjugation were the main metabolic pathways of senkyunolide A. This study provides an overview of the metabolic profiles of senkyunolide A, which is helpful for a better understanding of the action of this compound.

Untargeted metabolomics reveals alterations in metabolites of lipid metabolism and immune pathways in the serum of rats after long-term oral administration of Amalaki rasayana	MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Amalaki rasayana; Ayurvedic medicines; Metabolic profiling; Lipid metabolism; Leukotriene metabolism	ARACHIDONIC-ACID; GROWTH-FACTOR; OXIDATIVE STRESS; PPAR-GAMMA; DISEASE; ACTIVATION; OBESITY; DIET	Amalaki rasayana, a traditional preparation, is widely used by Ayurvedic physicians for the treatment of inflammatory conditions, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Metabolic alterations induced by Amalaki rasayana intervention are unknown. We investigated the modulations in serum metabolomic profiles in Wistar rats following long-term oral administration of Amalaki rasayana. Global metabolic profiling was performed of the serum of rats administered with either Amalaki rasayana (AR) or ghee + honey (GH) for 18 months and control animals which were left untreated. Amalaki rasayana components were confirmed from AR extract using HR-LCMS analysis. Significant reductions in prostaglandin J2, 11-dehydrothromboxane B2, and higher levels of reduced glutathione and glycitein metabolites were observed in the serum of AR administered rats compared to the control groups. Eleven different metabolites classified as phospholipids, glycerophospholipids, glucoside derivatives, organic acids, and glycosphingolipid were exclusively observed in the AR administered rats. Pathway analysis suggests that altered metabolites in AR administered rats are those associated with different biochemical pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, leukotriene metabolism, G-protein mediated events, phospholipid metabolism, and the immune system. Targeted metabolomics confirmed the presence of gallic acid, ellagic acid, and arachidonic acid components in the AR extract. The known activities of these components can be correlated with the altered metabolic profile following long-term AR administration. AR also activates IGF1R-Akt-Foxo3 signaling axis in heart tissues of rats administered with AR. Our study identifies AR components that induce alterations in lipid metabolism and immune pathways in animals which consume AR for an extended period.	[Kumar, Vikas; Kumar, A.

Alterations in gut microbiota (GMB) and host metabolites have been noted in individuals with HIV. However, it remains unclear whether alterations in GMB and related functional groups contribute to disrupted host metabolite profiles in these individuals. Methods. This study included 185 women (128 with longstanding HIV infection, 88% under antiretroviral therapy; and 57 women without HIV from the same geographic location with comparable characteristics). Stool samples were analyzed by 16S rRNA V4 region sequencing, and GMB function was inferred by PICRUSt. Plasma metabolomic profiling was performed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and 133 metabolites (amino acids, biogenic amines, acylcarnitines, and lipids) were analyzed. Results. Four predominant bacterial genera were identified as associated with HIV infection, with higher abundances of Ruminococcus and Oscillospira and lower abundances of Bifidobacterium and Collinsella in women with HIV than in those without. Women with HIV showed a distinct plasma metabolite profile, which featured elevated glycerophospholipid levels compared with those without HIV. Functional analyses also indicated that GMB lipid metabolism was enriched in women with HIV. Ruminococcus and Oscillospira were among the top bacterial genera contributing to the GMB glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway and showed positive correlations with host plasma glycerophospholipid levels. One bacterial functional capacity in the acetate and propionate biosynthesis pathway was identified to be mainly contributed by Bifidobacterium; this functional capacity was lower in women with HIV than in women without HIV. Conclusions. Our integrative analyses identified altered GMB with related functional capacities that might be associated with disrupted plasma metabolite profiles in women with HIV.

This metabolomics study aimed to identify new serum prognostic biomarkers to improve the prediction of overall survival in patients with metastatic STS. The study enrolled 24 patients treated with the same trabectedin regimen. The baseline serum metabolomics profile, targeted to 68 metabolites encompassing amino acids and bile acids pathways, was quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Correlations between individual metabolomics profiles and overall survival were examined and a risk model to predict survival was built by Cox multivariate regression. The median overall survival of the studied patients was 13.0 months (95% CI, 5.6-23.5). Among all the metabolites investigated, only citrulline and histidine correlated significantly with overall survival. The best Cox risk prediction model obtained integrating metabolomics and clinical data, included citrulline, hemoglobin and patients' performance status score. It allowed to distinguish patients into a high-risk group with a low median overall survival of 2.1 months and a low- to moderate-risk group with a median overall survival of 19.1 months (p< 0.0001). The results of this metabolomics translation study indicate that citrulline, an amino acid belonging to the arginine metabolism, represents an important metabolic signature that may contribute to explain the high inter-patients overall survival variability of STS patients. The risk prediction model based on baseline serum citrulline, hemoglobin and performance status may represent a new prognostic tool for the early classification of patients with metastatic STS, according to their overall survival expectancy.

L belongs to the Vitaceae family and is an important medicinal plant used in Mexico for the management of infectious diseases and tumors. The present study aimed to evaluate the metabolic profile of the stems of C. trifoliata and to correlate the results with their antibacterial and cytotoxic activities. The hexane extract was analyzed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and the CHCl3-MeOH and aqueous extracts by ultraperformance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of fly mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS). The antibacterial activity was determined by broth microdilution and the cytotoxicity was evaluated using MTS cell proliferation assay. Forty-six metabolites were putatively identified from the three extracts. Overall, terpenes, flavonoids and stilbenes characterize the metabolic profile. No antibacterial activity was found in any extract against the fifteen bacteria strains tested (MIC >500 mu g/mL). However, high cytotoxic activity (IC50 <= 30 mu g/mL) was found in the hexane and aqueous extracts against hepatocarcinoma and breast cancer cells (Hep3B, HepG2 and MCF7). This is the first report of the bioactive compounds of C. trifoliata stems and their antibacterial and cytotoxic properties. The metabolic profile rich in anticancer compounds correlate with the cytotoxic activity of the extracts from the stems of C. trifoliata. This study shows the antitumor effects of this plant used in the traditional medicine and justifies further research of its anticancer activity.

However, the exact pathogenesis of AS remains unclear. We aim to use the metabolomics analysis to characterize the metabolic profile of AS, in order to better understand the pathogenesis of AS and monitor disease activity and progression. Methods The ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-TQ-MS) was used for investigating the serum amino acid metabolomic profiling of 30 AS patients, in comparison with 32 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and 30 healthy controls, combined with multivariate statistical analysis. Metabolite association analysis with disease activity was performed using generalized linear regression. The metabolic pathway analysis for the important metabolites was performed using MetPA and the metabolic network was constructed. Results A total of 29 amino acids and biogenic amines were detected in all participants by UPLC-TQ-MS. It showed significant amino acid differences between the AS/RA patients and control subjects. Additionally, 4-hydroxy-L-proline, alanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, glutamine, and taurine were identified as candidate markers shared by AS/RA groups. Specifically, lysine, proline, serine, and alanine were found correlated with disease activity of AS. Furthermore, the most significant metabolic pathway identified were alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism. Conclusions These preliminary results demonstrate that UPLC-TQ-MS analysis method is a powerful tool to identify metabolite profiles of AS. Research in identified disease activity-associated metabolites and biological pathways may provide assistance for clinical diagnosis and pathological mechanism of AS.

In this study, an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry method was employed to investigate the metabolic profiles of a Cur self-emulsifying drug delivery system (C-SEDDS) in rat plasma, urine, bile and feces after oral administration at 100 mg/kg. Protein precipitation, solid-phase and ultrasonic extractions were used to prepare different biosamples. A total of 34 metabolites were identified using available reference standards, or tentatively identified based on the mass spectrometric fragmentation patterns and the chromatographic elution order. Nine metabolites of Cur were found for the first time in vivo. Glucuronidation, sulfation, reduction, dehydroxylation, demethylation, demethoxylation and methylation were its possible metabolic reactions. Moreover, the differences were compared in terms of plasma metabolites found in C-SEDDS-treated, Cur suspension-treated and rats treated with a commercial curcuminoid phospholipid complex administered at the same oral dose. Dihydrocurcumin (DHC), DHC glucuronide and methylated DHC were found only in the metabolic profile of C-SEDDS-treated rat plasma, suggesting that different drug delivery systems may cause a change in Cur metabolic pathways. This study provides a sensitive and rapid method for the identification of Cur metabolites in biosamples.

Metabolomic Fingerprinting of Potato Cultivars Differing in Susceptibility to Spongospora subterranea f. sp. subterranea Root Infection	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES			English	Article						potato roots; chromatogram; antimicrobial; phytoalexins; UPLC-MS; phytochemicals; root exudates; powdery scab	PHYTOPHTHORA-INFESTANS; ACID; DEFENSE; RESISTANCE; ARABIDOPSIS; ELICITATION; EXPRESSION; PROTECTION; REGULATOR; PATHWAYS	Plants defend themselves from pathogens by producing bioactive defense chemicals. The biochemical mechanisms relating to quantitative resistance of potato to root infection by Spongospora subterranea f. sp. subterranea (Sss) are, however, not understood, and are not efficiently utilized in potato breeding programs. Untargeted metabolomics using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) was used to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms of susceptibility to Sss root infection. Potato roots and root exudate metabolic profiles of five tolerant cultivars were compared with those of five susceptible cultivars, following Sss inoculation, to identify tolerance-related metabolites. Comparison of the relative metabolite abundance of tolerant versus susceptible cultivars revealed contrasting responses to Sss infection. Metabolites belonging to amino acids, organic acids, fatty acids, phenolics, and sugars, as well as well-known cell wall thickening compounds were putatively identified and were especially abundant in the tolerant cultivars relative to the susceptible cultivars. Metabolites known to activate plant secondary defense metabolism were significantly increased in the tolerant cultivars compared to susceptible cultivars following Sss inoculation. Root-exuded compounds belonging to the chemical class of phenolics were also found in abundance in the tolerant cultivars compared to susceptible cultivars. This study illustrated that Sss infection of potato roots leads to differential expression of metabolites in tolerant and susceptible potato cultivars.

Understanding the mechanisms of tilapia infection leading to a high mortality rate at warm temperatures is critical for aquaculture. In this work, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) coupled with pattern recognition methods and pathway analysis was used to study the metabolic responses in the sera of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) induced by S. agalactiae infection at two temperatures. The metabolic profiles showed differences in fish affected by infection raised under different conditions. At 25 degrees C, a normal temperature for tilapia subsistence, the infection caused changes mainly in energy metabolism, fatty acid composition, and steroid hormone responses, as indicated by 20 corresponding differentially abundant metabolites. At 35 degrees C, an increased temperature, 27 differentially abundant metabolites identified in infected tilapia compared with those in uninfected tilapia demonstrated more severe and extensive disturbances in energy metabolism and fatty acid metabolism than those at 25 degrees C. Additionally, the effects of infection also involve enriched carbohydrate-derived structural substances associated with the immune response, but no steroid stress changes were found at high temperature. Metabolites and pathways that were commonly affected by infection at both temperatures indicated that inhibition of glycolysis and consumption of arachidonic acid are more pronounced at high temperature than at normal temperature and might be related to deterioration and death in tilapia. This research provides valuable information for understanding pathogenesis and finding effective methods to control streptococcosis during the warm season.

However, in vivo biotransformation of PNS mediated by gut microbiota is not well known. This study aimed to characterize the in vivo metabolic profiles of PNS mediated by gut microbiota. The saponins and yielded metabolites in rat feces were identified and relatively quantified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Seventy-three PNS metabolites had been identified in the normal control group, but only 11 PNS metabolites were determined in the pseudo germ-free (GF) group. In addition, the main biotransformation pathway of PNS metabolism was hydrolytic and dehydration reactions. The results indicated that a significant metabolic difference was observed between the normal control group and pseudo GF group, while gut microbiota played a profound role in the biotransformation of PNS in vivo.

Important agronomic traits such as productivity and resistance to stresses are to be regarded as the result of the combined responses of individual organs and their inter-communication. Ultimately, these responses directly reflect the metabolic profile at the cellular level. Above ground, the complexity of the plant phenotype is governed by leaves at different developmental stages, and their ability to synthesise and exchange metabolites. In this study, the metabolic profile of differently-developed leaves was used firstly to discriminate flax leaf developmental stages, and secondly to analyse the allocation of the metabolites within and between leaves. For this purpose, the concentration of 52 metabolites, both primary and specialized, was followed by gas chromatography (GC-) and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in alternate pairs of flax leaves. On the basis of their metabolic content, three populations of leaves in different growth stages could be distinguished. Primary and specialized metabolites showed characteristic distribution patterns, and compounds similarly evolving with leaf age could be grouped by the aid of the Kohonen self-organising map (SOM) algorithm. Ultimately, visualisation of the correlations between metabolites via hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) allowed the assessment of the metabolic fluxes characterising different leaf developmental stages, and the investigation of the relationships between primary and specialized metabolites.

However, many diabetes patients consume food with higher fat content for a better taste bud experience. In this study, we examined the effect of HFD on rats at the early onset of diabetes and prediabetes by supplementing their feed with palm olein oil to provide a fat content representing 39% of total calorie intake. Urinary profile generated from liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was used to construct the orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) score plots. The data provide insights into the physiological state of an organism. Healthy rats fed with normal chow (NC) and HFD cannot be distinguished by their urinary metabolite profiles, whereas diabetic and prediabetic rats showed a clear separation in OPLS-DA profile between the two diets, indicating a change in their physiological state. Metformin treatment altered the metabolomics profiles of diabetic rats and lowered their blood sugar levels. For prediabetic rats, metformin treatment on both NC- and HFD-fed rats not only reduced their blood sugar levels to normal but also altered the urinary metabolite profile to be more like healthy rats. The use of metformin is therefore beneficial at the prediabetes stage.

Here we found that micro- and nano-sized vesicles (MVs and NVs) from four Citrus species, C. sinensis, C. limon, C. paradisi and C. aurantium, specifically inhibit the proliferation of lung, skin and breast cancer cells, with no substantial effect on the growth of non-cancer cells. Cellular and molecular analyses demonstrate that grapefruit-derived vesicles cause cell cycle arrest at G2/M checkpoint associated with a reduced cyclins B1 and B2 expression levels and the upregulation of cell cycle inhibitor p21. Further data suggest the inhibition of Akt and ERK signalling, reduced intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 and cathepsins expressions, and the presence of cleaved PARP-1, all associated with the observed changes at the cellular level. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics reveals distinct metabolite profiles for the juice and vesicle fractions. NVs exhibit a high relative amount of amino acids and organic acids whereas MVs and fruit juice are characterized by a high percentage of sugars and sugar derivatives. Grapefruit-derived NVs are in particular rich in alpha-hydroxy acids and leucine/isoleucine, myo-inositol and doconexent, while quininic acid was detected in MVs. Our findings reveal the metabolite signatures of grapefruit-derived vesicles and substantiate their potential use in new anticancer strategies.

Metabolomic signatures for visceral adiposity and dysglycaemia in Asian Chinese and Caucasian European adults: the cross-sectional TOFI_Asia study	NUTRITION & METABOLISM			English	Article						Metabolomics; Type 2 diabetes; Visceral adiposity	LOW-DENSITY-LIPOPROTEIN; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; INSULIN-RESISTANCE; PEAK DETECTION; ECTOPIC FAT; LIFE-STYLE; RISK; TISSUE; OBESITY; MELLITUS	Background Asian Chinese are more susceptible to deposition of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) development than European Caucasians when matched for gender, age and body mass index (BMI). Our aims were: (i) characterise the ethnicity-specific metabolomic signature of visceral adiposity measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and (ii) identify individuals susceptible to worse metabolic health outcomes. Methods Fasting plasma samples from normoglycaemic (n = 274) and prediabetic (n = 83) participants were analysed with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using untargeted metabolomics. Multiple linear regression adjusting for age, gender and BMI was performed to identify metabolites associated with FPG and VAT calculated as percentage of total body fat (%VAT(TBF)) in each ethnic group. Metabolic risk groups in each ethnicity were stratified based on the joint metabolomic signature for FPG and %VAT(TBF) and clinically characterised using partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and t-tests. Results FPG was correlated with 40 and 110 metabolites in Caucasians and Chinese respectively, with diglyceride DG(38:5) (adjusted beta = 0.29, p = 3.00E-05) in Caucasians and triglyceride TG(54:4) (adjusted beta = 0.28, p = 2.02E-07) in Chinese being the most significantly correlated metabolite based on the p-value. %VAT(TBF) was correlated with 85 and 119 metabolites in Caucasians and Chinese respectively, with TG(56:2) (adjusted beta = 0.3, p = 8.25E-09) in Caucasians and TG(58:3) (adjusted beta = 0.25, p = 2.34E-08) in Chinese being the most significantly correlated. 24 metabolites associated with FPG were common to both ethnicities including glycerolipid species. 67 metabolites associated with %VAT(TBF) were common to both ethnicities including positive correlations with dihydroceramide, sphingomyelin, glycerolipid, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethnolamine, and inverse correlations with ether-linked phosphatidylcholine. Participant re-stratification found greater total and central adiposity, worse clinical lipid profiles, higher serum glucoregulatory peptides and liver enzymes in normal fasting glucose (NFG) individuals with a prediabetic metabolomic profile than NFG individuals with a normoglycaemic metabolomic profile in both ethnicities. Conclusions Untargeted metabolomics identified common and disparate metabolites associated with FPG and %VAT(TBF), with an ethnic-dimorphic signature for these metabolic traits. These signatures could improve risk stratification and identify NFG individuals with an adverse cardiometabolic and T2D risk profile.

In this study, we aimed to characterize the differential serum metabolomic profiles between pre-operative and post-operative patients with colorectal cancer. To investigate the significant metabolites and metabolic pathways associated with colorectal cancer, we analyzed serum samples from 68 patients (aged 20-71, mean 57.57 years). Untargeted and targeted metabolomics profiling in patients with colorectal cancer were performed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Untargeted analysis identified differences in sphingolipid metabolism, steroid biosynthesis, and arginine and proline metabolism in pre- and post-operative patients with colorectal cancer. We then performed quantitative target profiling of polyamines, synthesized from arginine and proline metabolism, to identify potential polyamines that may serve as effective biomarkers for colorectal cancer. Results indicate a significantly reduced serum concentration of putrescine in post-operative patients compared to pre-operative patients. Our metabolomics approach provided insights into the physiological alterations in patients with colorectal cancer after surgery.

Biomarkers can provide insight into the mechanism, facilitate early detection, and monitor progression of MetS and its response to therapeutic interventions. To identify potential biomarkers, we applied a non-targeted and targeted lipidomics method to characterize plasma metabolic profile in MetS patients. Metabolic profiling was performed on a non-target set (40 cases and 40 controls) on UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS and target set (80 MetS patients and 80 healthy controls) on UHPLC-Q-orbitrap MS. Using comprehensive screening and validation workflow, we identified a panel of three metabolites including PC(18:1/P-16:0), PC(o-22:3/22:3), PC(P-18:1/16:1). Our results indicated that the identified biomarkers may improve the risk prediction and provide a novel tool for monitoring of the progression of disease and response to treatment in MetS patients.

K. Richt.) is a traditional culinary spice from South-East Europe. Studies of N. siculum have focused mainly on the botanical and taxonomic characteristics of this species and there is no data available in the scientific literature about its metabolite profile. Thus, the aim of the current study was metabolite profiling of four wild populations of N. siculum grown in Bulgaria by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and subsequent principal component analysis (PCA) of the data obtained. The identified primary metabolites (carbohydrates, amino acids, organic acids and lipids) are initial compounds for the biosynthesis of different plant secondary metabolites, such as polyphenols and flavour compounds with valuable biological activities for humans. The health benefits of the phenolic acids identified in this study have been a prerequisite for the implementation of N. siculum in different food systems in order to increase their quality and biological value.

Methods: Survivors were recruited from the surgical outpatient department and the oncology clinic of a medical center in northern Taiwan. Fatigue was assessed using the Fatigue Symptom Inventory. Fasting blood samples were collected on the day the fatigue questionnaire was completed. Metabolomic profile analysis was performed using non-targeted, liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Fold change analyses, t-tests, and pathway analyses were performed to identify differences in metabolomic profiles between the fatigued and non-fatigued survivors. Results: Of the 56 CRC survivors in this study, 28.6% (n = 16) were in the fatigue group. Statistically significant differences in carnitine, L-norleucine, pyroglutamic acid, pyrrolidonecarboxylic acid, spermine, hydroxyoctanoic acid, and paraxanthine were found between the two fatigue groups. In addition, two pathways were enriched for these metabolites (i.e., glutathione metabolism, D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism). Conclusions: Findings from this pilot study provide preliminary evidence that two pathways that are involved with the regulation of ATP production and cellular energy (i.e., glutathione metabolism, D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism) are associated with fatigue in CRC survivors. If these findings are confirmed, they may provide new therapeutic targets to decrease fatigue in cancer survivors.

However, previous dioxin toxicity studies primarily focused on the activation of AhR with signaling pathways at gene and protein levels. The investigation of underlying mechanisms at the metabolic level is still necessary. In this study, serum samples of 48 and 47 healthy participants with the highest and lowest dioxin levels based on quartile distribution of the serum dioxin concentrations of 215 male adults were selected for metabolomics analysis by using liquid chromatography coupled with orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry to investigate dioxin-related metabolic responses. The identified potential biomarkers included acylcarnitines, fatty acids and derivatives, glycerophospholipids, etc. suggested that metabolic pathways such as fatty acid beta-oxidation, essential fatty acid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism and purine metabolism were disturbed by dioxin exposure. The results indicated that people with high dioxin exposure levels were at the potential health risks of inflammation, liver and cardiovascular diseases. The metabolic findings may help understand the link between dioxin exposure and the diseases.

Metabolomics has the potential to uncover novel targeted treatment strategies by identifying metabolic pathways required for cancer cells to survive and proliferate. Methods The metabolic profiles of two histologically distinct breast cancer subtypes from a MMTV-Myc mouse model, epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) and papillary, were investigated using mass spectrometry-based metabolomics methods. Based on metabolic profiles, drugs most likely to be effective against each subtype were selected and tested. Results We found that the EMT and papillary subtypes display different metabolic preferences. Compared to the papillary subtype, the EMT subtype exhibited increased glutathione and TCA cycle metabolism, while the papillary subtype exhibited increased nucleotide biosynthesis compared to the EMT subtype. Targeting these distinct metabolic pathways effectively inhibited cancer cell proliferation in a subtype-specific manner. Conclusions Our results demonstrate the feasibility of metabolic profiling to develop novel personalized therapy strategies for different subtypes of breast cancer. Graphical abstract Schematic overview of the experimental design for drug selection based on breast cancer subtype-specific metabolism. The epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and papillary tumors are histologically distinct mouse mammary tumor subtypes from the MMTV-Myc mouse model. Cell lines derived from tumors can be used to determine metabolic pathways that can be used to select drug candidates for each subtype.

While kava has a large global consumer footprint for its clinical and recreational use, factors related to its use lack standardization and the tissue-specific metabolite profile of its neuroactive constituents is not well understood. Results: Here we characterized the metabolomic profile and spatio-temporal characteristics of tissues from the roots and stems using cross-platform metabolomics and a 3D imaging approach. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed the highest content of kavalactones in crown root peels and lateral roots. Infrared matrix-assisted laser desorption electrospray ionization (IR-MALDESI) imaging revealed a unique tissue-specific presence of each target kavalactone. X-ray micro-computed tomography analysis demonstrated that lateral roots have morphological characteristics suitable for synthesis of the highest content of kavalactones. Conclusions: These results provide mechanistic insights into the social and clinical practice of the use of only peeled roots by linking specific tissue characteristics to concentrations of neuroactive compounds.

In this study, ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS)-based metabolomics was used to elucidate the antimicrobial mechanism of 3-carene in P. fluorescens. Multivariate analysis of the metabolite data revealed significant differences in the potential metabolite profiles between groups. The results of univariate analysis showed that significant changes in 42 metabolites were observed after treatment with 3-carene for 12 h when compared to the control group. Moreover, 3-carene treatment resulted in disturbances in many metabolic processes, including amino acid metabolism, pantothenate and coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. These results provide a new insight into the antimicrobial mechanisms of 3-carene in P. fluorescens and enhance our understanding of the antimicrobial mechanism from a metabolic perspective.

To better understand the disposition and action of ligustilide, it is necessary to investigate the metabolic profiles. The in vitro metabolism was elucidated through incubating ligustilide with human and rat hepatocytes at 37 degrees C. The incubation samples were collected at predefined time points to determine the metabolic stability. Upon metabolite identification and profiling, the incubation samples were analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography combined with diode array detector and high-resolution mass spectrometry. The structures of the metabolites were characterized based on their mass spectrometry spectra, tandem mass spectrometry spectra, and fragmentation patterns. Ligustilide showed fast metabolism with high intrinsic clearance both in rat and human hepatocyte incubations. The half-lives of ligustilide in rat and human hepatocyte incubations were 8.0 and 15.0 min, respectively. Most of the parent (>90%) was biotransformed into the metabolites. Among these metabolites, M1 (senkyunolide I) was the major metabolite both in rat and human hepatocytes with the percentage of 42 and 70%, respectively. The metabolic pathways of ligustilide included epoxidation, epoxide hydrolysis, aromatization, hydroxylation, and glutathionylation. This work provided an overview of the metabolic profiles of ligustilide, which would be helpful for us to understand the action of this compound.

Previously, we reported that wheat transgenic lines overexpressing GmDREB1 showed increased tolerance to drought and salt stress. However, the molecular basis of increased tolerance is still poorly understood, and whether the overexpression of DREB will cause unexpected effects is also of concern. We performed seed metabolic profiling of the genetically modified (GM) wheat T349 and three non-GM cultivars with LC-MS to identify the metabolic basis of stress tolerance and to assess the unexpected effects of exogenous gene insertion. Although we did not note the appearance of novel metabolites or the disappearance of existing metabolites, overexpression of the transcription factor GmDREB1 in T349 wheat influenced metabolite levels in seeds. Increased levels of stress tolerance-associated metabolites were found in the stress-sensitive non-transgenic acceptor counterpart J19, while metabolites associated with cell membrane structure and stability accumulated in T349. Among these metabolites in T349, most showed levels similar to those in the non-GM wheats. Overexpression of GmDREB1 in T349 may cause a shift in its metabolic profile leading to down-regulation of several energy-consuming processes to favor increased yield under stress conditions, which is a reasonable expectation of breeders while creating the GM wheat and GmDREB1 overexpression did not cause unexpected effects in T349 seeds. These results may be helpful for GM crop research and risk assessment. (C) 2020 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CARS.

While various studies have analyzed the relationship between ripening duration and sensory characteristics, no studies have evaluated ham products produced in Japan. Here, we conducted time-course metabolomic profiling, taste sensor-based analyses, and sensory evaluations by non-trained consumers during ripening. Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry was used to quantify non-volatile metabolites, such as amino acids, organic acids, and nucleotides. In an analysis of eight time-points during 680 days of ripening, the highest score for the after-taste of umami was observed on day 540, despite subtle changes in the scores for other properties. The concentrations of aspartic acid and glutamic acid relative to those of total amino acids were the highest at this point. This approach can contribute to the understanding of the relationship between the metabolite profile and ripening duration.

Methods The metabolic profile of 4,4 '-dimethylaminorex was characterized using both in vitro and in vivo models. In detail, for the in vitro experiments, either pooled human liver microsomes or recombinant cytochrome P450 isoforms were selected, whereas the in vivo investigation was performed on male mice ICR (CD-1(R)). Sample preparation included enzymatic hydrolysis followed by liquid/liquid extraction. The instrumental analysis was performed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to either high- or low-resolution tandem mass spectrometry. Results Five metabolic products were isolated only for thecis-isomer: the phase I metabolic reactions included hydrolysis, carboxylation, hydroxylation, and carbonylation. CYP2D6 was the principal isoenzyme involved, and the incubation in the presence of different allelic variants showed significant alteration on the metabolic profile. Once formed, the phase I metabolites underwent extensive conjugation. Not only the most abundant compounds detected, but also those with the most extended window of detection, were the carboxylated and the hydroxylated metabolites. These analytes together with the parent compound were selected as the most suitable markers of intake. Conclusions Knowledge of the metabolic profiles of the new drugs is essential for their fast identification. Phase I and phase II metabolites of 4,4 '-dimethylaminorex were identified and selected as markers of intake, to be considered as the most suitable analytical targets in forensic toxicology.

We compared the metabolomic profiles of the aqueous humor between wet AMD patients (n = 26) and age- and sex-matched patients undergoing cataract surgery without AMD as controls (n = 20). A global untargeted metabolomics study was performed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Univariate analysis after the false discovery correction showed 18 significantly altered metabolites among the 291 metabolites measured. These differential metabolomic profiles pointed to three interconnected metabolic pathways: a compromised carnitine-associated mitochondrial oxidation pathway (carnitine, deoxycarnitine, N6-trimethyl-L-lysine), an altered carbohydrate metabolism pathway (cis-aconitic acid, itaconatic acid, and mesaconic acid), which plays a role in senescence and immunity, and an activated osmoprotection pathway (glycine betaine, creatine), which potentially contributes to the pathogenesis of the disease. These results suggested that metabolic dysfunction in AMD is mitochondrial-centered and may provide new insights into the pathophysiology of wet AMD and novel therapeutic strategies.

Metabolomics is increasingly being used in the study of infectious diseases. We performed metabolome profiling to identify potential biomarkers in patients with active TB. Serum samples from 21 patients with active pulmonary TB, 20 subjects with latent TB infection (LTBI), and 28 healthy controls were analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) followed by multivariate and univariate analyses. Metabolic profiles indicated higher serum levels of glutamate, sulfoxy methionine, and aspartate and lower serum levels of glutamine, methionine, and asparagine in active TB patients than in LTBI subjects or healthy controls. The ratios between metabolically related partners (glutamate/glutamine, sulfoxy methionine/methionine, and aspartate/asparagine) were also elevated in the active TB group. There was no significant difference in the serum concentration of these metabolites according to the disease extent or risk of relapse in active TB patients. Novel serum biomarkers such as glutamate, sulfoxy methionine, aspartate, glutamine, methionine, and asparagine are potentially useful for adjunctive, rapid, and noninvasive pulmonary TB diagnosis.

This method was successfully applied to investigate the metabolic profiles of Ermiao wan (EMW) formula in the bile of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Based on accurate mass information and fragment patterns, 23 alkaloids and lactones metabolites were tentatively identified. Their metabolic pathway involved in glucuronidation, sulfation, hydroxylation and hydrolysis. Because of the high time resolution of microdialysis, the metabolic profiles of EMW were also investigated. Jatrorrhizine, columbamine and other components showed a "double-peak" profiles, suggesting the existence of enterohepatic circulation. The developed microdialysis sampling/ LC-qTOE-MS method provides a simple and efficient research tool for understanding and clarifying the mechanism of hepatobiliary excretion of complex components.

In this context, this study aimed to look into the phytochemical profiles in detail and to explore the antitumor potential of S. tuberosa and S. mombin leaves. We observed that, S. tuberosa leaf extract was cytotoxic in both tumor and healthy cells. S. mombin extracts selectively inhibited cell proliferation in the tumor cell line for prostate cancer (PC3) and did not significantly affect healthy cells. The metabolic profiles of the extracts were evaluated by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry and twenty-three metabolites were identified. The correlation of metabolic profiles with cytotoxic tests indicated possible chemical markers that may be responsible for the inhibition of cell proliferation. This study revealed that the unexplored co-products in agroindustry may have great therapeutic potential, and therefore should be screened for biologically active compounds.	[Guedes, Jhonyson A.

This study aimed to obtain the metabolic and pharmacokinetic data of sennoside B. The metabolic profiles of sennoside B were obtained from rat plasma, urine, bile and feces by an ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). As a result, 14 metabolites were structurally identified and the proposed metabolic pathways of sennoside B included hydrolysis to aglycones, release of rhein-type anthrone, and extensive conjugation. As the only compound detected in the plasma samples after intravenous and intragastric administrations, the prototype was selected as the plasma marker in the pharmacokinetic study. A simple and sensitive ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed for the quantitation of sennoside B in rat plasma. The linear range of sennoside B was 5-1000 ng/mL (R-2 >= 0.991) and the lowest limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 5 ng/mL. The intra- and inter- precisions of the assay were less than 10%, whereas accuracy ranged from 85.80% to 103.80%. The extraction recovery, matrix effect and stability of sennoside B were within acceptable limits. The established method was well validated and successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic study of sennoside B. The oral absolute bioavailability of sennoside B was calculated as 3.60% and the value apparent volume of distribution of intravenous and intragastric administrations were 32.47 +/- 10.49 L/kg and 7646 +/- 1784 L/kg, respectively. The maximum plasma concentrations were 212.6 +/- 50.9 mu g/L and 14.06 +/- 2.73 mu g/L for intravenous and intragastric dosing groups, respectively. According to the current results of pharmacokinetic and metabolic profiling studies, metabolites with high abundance in tissues would be the next object in the pharmacokinetic study of sennoside B.

It is currently unknown when, and if, individual premutation carriers will develop FXTAS. Thus, with the aim of identifying biomarkers for early diagnosis, development, and progression of FXTAS, we performed global metabolomic profiling of premutation carriers (PM) who, as part of an ongoing longitudinal study, emerged into two distinct categories: those who developed symptoms of FXTAS (converters, CON) at subsequent visits and those who did not (non-converters, NCON) and we compared to age-matched healthy controls (HC). We assessed CGG repeat allele size by Southern Blot and PCR analysis. Metabolomic profile was obtained by ultra-performance liquid chromatography, accurate mass spectrometer, and an Orbitrap mass analyzer. In this study we found 47 metabolites were significantly dysregulated between HC and the premutation groups (PM). Importantly, we identified 24 metabolites that showed significant changes in expression in the CON as compared to the NCON both at V1 and V2, and 70 metabolites in CON as compared to NCON but only at V2. These findings suggest the potential role of the identified metabolites as biomarkers for early diagnosis and for FXTAS disease progression, respectively. Interestingly, the majority of the identified metabolites were lipids, followed by amino acids. To our knowledge, this the first report of longitudinal metabolic profiling and identification of unique biomarkers of FXTAS. The lipid metabolism and specifically the sub pathways involved in mitochondrial bioenergetics, as observed in other neurodegenerative disorders, are significantly altered in FXTAS.

Patterns in metabolite profile are associated with risk of more aggressive prostate cancer: A prospective study of 3,057 matched case-control sets from EPIC	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER			English	Article						epidemiology; metabolomics; prostate cancer risk; treelet transform	MALE MEAT-EATERS; TREELET TRANSFORM; BREAST-CANCER; AMINO-ACIDS; FISH-EATERS; METABOLOMICS; PROLIFERATION; VEGETARIANS; VARIABILITY; VEGANS	Metabolomics may reveal novel insights into the etiology of prostate cancer, for which few risk factors are established. We investigated the association between patterns in baseline plasma metabolite profile and subsequent prostate cancer risk, using data from 3,057 matched case-control sets from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). We measured 119 metabolite concentrations in plasma samples, collected on average 9.4 years before diagnosis, by mass spectrometry (AbsoluteIDQ p180 Kit, Biocrates Life Sciences AG). Metabolite patterns were identified using treelet transform, a statistical method for identification of groups of correlated metabolites. Associations of metabolite patterns with prostate cancer risk (OR1SD) were estimated by conditional logistic regression. Supplementary analyses were conducted for metabolite patterns derived using principal component analysis and for individual metabolites. Men with metabolite profiles characterized by higher concentrations of either phosphatidylcholines or hydroxysphingomyelins (OR1SD = 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.66-0.89), acylcarnitines C18:1 and C18:2, glutamate, ornithine and taurine (OR1SD = 0.72, 0.57-0.90), or lysophosphatidylcholines (OR1SD = 0.81, 0.69-0.95) had lower risk of advanced stage prostate cancer at diagnosis, with no evidence of heterogeneity by follow-up time. Similar associations were observed for the two former patterns with aggressive disease risk (the more aggressive subset of advanced stage), while the latter pattern was inversely related to risk of prostate cancer death (OR 1SD = 0.77, 0.61-0.96). No associations were observed for prostate cancer overall or less aggressive tumor subtypes. In conclusion, metabolite patterns may be related to lower risk of more aggressive prostate tumors and prostate cancer death, and might be relevant to etiology of advanced stage prostate cancer. What's new? This prospective study is the largest investigation of metabolite profile and prostate cancer risk, to date. We found that patterns in plasma metabolite profile (characterized by higher concentrations of phosphatidylcholines and hydroxysphingomyelins; specific acylcarnitines, amino acids and a biogenic amine; and lysophosphatidylcholines, respectively) were associated with subsequent lower risk of more aggressive tumor subtypes and prostate cancer death. Moreover, the results suggest that metabolite profile may be relevant to the etiology of advanced stage disease.

BACTERIAL PANICLE BLIGHT; BURKHOLDERIA-GLUMAE; SECONDARY METABOLISM; 1ST REPORT; RICE; SPECTROSCOPY; GLADIOLI; DRUGS; CROP	Actinobacteria are the major source of bioactive secondary metabolites and are featured in the search for antimicrobial compounds. We used nuclear magnetic resonance (RMN)-metabolic profiling and multivariate data analysis (MVDA) to correlate the metabolites' production of Streptomyces sp. PNM-9 from the algae Dictyota sp. and their biological activity against the rice phytopathogenic bacteria Burkholderia spp. The compounds 2-methyl-N-(2 '-phenylethyl)-butanamide (1) and 3-methyl-N-(2 '-phenylethyl)-butanamide (2) were identified through MVDA and 2D NMR experiments in the organic extract of a 15-days LB media culture of Streptomyces sp. PNM-9. Compounds 1 and 2 were isolated and their structures confirmed by oneand two-dimensional NMR and mass spectrometry (MS) data. Compounds 1 and 2 were active against the rice pathogenic bacteria Burkholderia glumae (ATCC 33,617) displaying minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 2.43 mM and 1.21 mM, respectively. The metabolomics-guided approach employing NMR-metabolic profiling was useful for marine microbial bioprospecting and suggested Streptomyces sp. PNM-9 strain and its compounds as a potential control against phytopathogenic bacteria.

The aim is to identify the distinct plasma metabolomics profiles associated with overall intakes of protein as well as with intakes from animal and plant protein sources. Methods and results A cross-sectional analysis using data from 1833 participants at high risk of cardiovascular disease is conducted. Associations between 385 identified metabolites and the intake of total, animal protein (AP), and plant protein (PP), and plant-to-animal ratio (PR) are assessed using elastic net continuous regression analyses. A double 10-cross-validation (CV) procedure is used and Pearson correlations coefficients between multi-metabolite weighted models and reported protein intake in each pair of training-validation datasets are calculated. A wide set of metabolites is consistently associated with each protein source evaluated. These metabolites mainly consisted of amino acids and their derivatives, acylcarnitines, different organic acids, and lipid species. Few metabolites overlapped among protein sources (i.e., C14:0 SM, C20:4 carnitine, GABA, and allantoin) but none of them toward the same direction. Regarding AP and PP approaches, C20:4 carnitine and dimethylglycine are positively associated with PP but negatively associated with AP. However, allantoin, C14:0 SM, C38:7 PE plasmalogen, GABA, metronidazole, and trigonelline (N-methylnicotinate) behave contrarily. Ten-CV Pearson correlation coefficients between self-reported protein intake and plasma metabolomics profiles range from 0.21 for PR to 0.32 for total protein. Conclusions Different sets of metabolites are associated with total, animal, and plant protein intake. Further studies are needed to assess the contribution of these metabolites in protein biomarkers' discovery and prediction of cardiometabolic alterations.

In this paper, the RNA sequencing and ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) technologies were used to study the transcriptome and metabolite profiles of the roots of continuously cropped soybeans that were infected withF. mosseaeandF. oxysporum. The objective was to explore the effects ofF. mosseaetreatment on soybean root rot infected withF. oxysporum. Results According to the transcriptome profiles, 24,285 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, and the expression of genes encoding phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), trans-cinnamate monooxygenase (CYP73A), cinnamyl-CoA reductase (CCR), chalcone isomerase (CHI) and coffee-coenzyme o-methyltransferase were upregulated after being infected withF. oxysporum; these changes were key to the induction of the soybean's defence response. The metabolite results showed that daidzein and 7,4-dihydroxy, 6-methoxy isoflavone (glycine), which are involved in the isoflavone metabolic pathway, were upregulated after the roots were inoculated withF. mosseae.In addition, a substantial alteration in the abundance of amino acids, phenolic and terpene metabolites all led to the synthesis of defence compounds. An integrated analysis of the metabolic and transcriptomic data revealed that substantial alterations in the abundance of most of the intermediate metabolites and enzymes changed substantially under pathogen infection. These changes included the isoflavonoid biosynthesis pathway, which suggests that isoflavonoid biosynthesis plays an important role in the soybean root response. Conclusion The results showed thatF. mosseaecould alleviate the root rot caused by continuous cropping. The increased activity of some disease-resistant genes and disease-resistant metabolites may partly account for the ability of the plants to resist diseases. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanism by which AMF alleviates soybean root rot, which is important in agriculture.

We recently showed thatT. gondiiinfection can alter the global metabolism of the cerebral cortex of mice. However, the impact ofT. gondiiinfection on the metabolism of the cerebellum remains unknown. Here we apply metabolomic profiling to discover metabolic changes associated withT. gondiiinfection of the mouse cerebellum using ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Multivariate statistics revealed differences in the metabolic profiles between the infected and control mouse groups and between the infected mouse groups as infection advanced. We also detected 10, 22, and 42 significantly altered metabolites (SAMs) in the infected cerebellum at 7, 14, and 21 days post infection (dpi), respectively. Four metabolites [tabersonine, arachidonic acid (AA), docosahexaenoic acid, and oleic acid] were identified as potential biomarker or responsive metabolites toT. gondiiinfection in the mouse cerebellum. Three of these metabolites (AA, docosahexaenoic acid, and oleic acid) play roles in the regulation of host behavior and immune response. Pathway analysis showed thatT. gondiiinfection of the cerebellum involves reprogramming of amino acid and lipid metabolism. These results showcase temporal metabolomic changes during cerebellar infection byT. gondiiin mice. The study provides new insight into the neuropathogenesis ofT. gondiiinfection and reveals new metabolites and pathways that mediate the interplay betweenT. gondiiand the mouse cerebellum.

Current knowledge on metabolic perturbations in HCC is derived mostly from case-control designs, with sparse information from prospective cohorts. Our objective was to apply comprehensive metabolite profiling to detect metabolites whose serum concentrations are associated with HCC development, using biological samples from within the prospective European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort (>520 000 participants), where we identified 129 HCC cases matched 1:1 to controls. We conducted high-resolution untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics on serum samples collected at recruitment prior to cancer diagnosis. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was applied controlling for dietary habits, alcohol consumption, smoking, body size, hepatitis infection and liver dysfunction. Corrections for multiple comparisons were applied. Of 9206 molecular features detected, 220 discriminated HCC cases from controls. Detailed feature annotation revealed 92 metabolites associated with HCC risk, of which 14 were unambiguously identified using pure reference standards. Positive HCC-risk associations were observed forN1-acetylspermidine, isatin,p-hydroxyphenyllactic acid, tyrosine, sphingosine,l,l-cyclo(leucylprolyl), glycochenodeoxycholic acid, glycocholic acid and 7-methylguanine. Inverse risk associations were observed for retinol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, glycerophosphocholine, gamma-carboxyethyl hydroxychroman and creatine. Discernible differences for these metabolites were observed between cases and controls up to 10 years prior to diagnosis. Our observations highlight the diversity of metabolic perturbations involved in HCC development and replicate previous observations (metabolism of bile acids, amino acids and phospholipids) made in Asian and Scandinavian populations. These findings emphasize the role of metabolic pathways associated with steroid metabolism and immunity and specific dietary and environmental exposures in HCC development.

We investigated the metabolomic profiles of three IAS species: Chromolaena odorata (Asteraceae) Datura stramonium (Solanaceae), and Xanthium strumarium (Asteraceae), comparing metabolites of individual plants in their native habitats (USA), to their invasive counterparts growing in and around Kruger National Park (South Africa, ZA). Metabolomic samples were collected using RApid Metabolome Extraction and Storage (RAMES) technology, which immobilizes phytochemicals on glass fiber disks, reducing compound degradation, allowing long-term, storage and simplifying biochemical analysis. Metabolomic differences were analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) of samples eluted from RAMES disks. Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) of metabolomes of individual plants allowed statistical separation of species, native and invasive populations of each species, and some populations on the same continent. Invasive populations of all species were more phytochemically diverse than their native counterparts, and their metabolomic profiles were statistically distinguishable from their native relatives.

Malignancy Grade-Dependent Mapping of Metabolic Landscapes in Human Urothelial Bladder Cancer: Identification of Novel, Diagnostic, and Druggable Biomarkers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES			English	Article						biomarker; bladder; cancer; grade; metabolomics; MS; NMR	SOFTWARE ENVIRONMENT; EARLY DISSEMINATION; GAS-CHROMATOGRAPHY; METASTASIS; REVEALS; SERUM; EXTRACTION; CYTOSCAPE; THYMOSINS; PROFILES	Background: Urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) is one of the cancers with the highest mortality rate and prevalence worldwide; however, the clinical management of the disease remains challenging. Metabolomics has emerged as a powerful tool with beneficial applications in cancer biology and thus can provide new insights on the underlying mechanisms of UBC progression and/or reveal novel diagnostic and therapeutic schemes. Methods: A collection of four human UBC cell lines that critically reflect the different malignancy grades of UBC was employed; RT4 (grade I), RT112 (grade II), T24 (grade III), and TCCSUP (grade IV). They were examined using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Mass Spectrometry, and advanced statistical approaches, with the goal of creating new metabolic profiles that are mechanistically associated with UBC progression toward metastasis. Results: Distinct metabolic profiles were observed for each cell line group, with T24 (grade III) cells exhibiting the most abundant metabolite contents. AMP and creatine phosphate were highly increased in the T24 cell line compared to the RT4 (grade I) cell line, indicating the major energetic transformation to which UBC cells are being subjected during metastasis. Thymosin beta 4 and beta 10 were also profiled with grade-specific patterns of expression, strongly suggesting the importance of actin-cytoskeleton dynamics for UBC advancement to metastatic and drug-tolerant forms. Conclusions: The present study unveils a novel and putatively druggable metabolic signature that holds strong promise for early diagnosis and the successful chemotherapy of UBC disease.

Metabolomics Approach to Assess the Relative Contributions of the Volatile and Non-volatile Composition to Expert Quality Ratings of Pinot Noir Wine Quality	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY			English	Article						wine quality; Pinot Noir; metabolomics; volatiles; non-volatiles; partial least squares regression		Wine flavor and quality are determined by the assessment of multiple sensory stimuli, including aroma, taste, and mouthfeel. It is therefore important to consider the contribution of as many metabolites as possible when attempting to relate wine composition to quality. In this study, partial least squares regression of the volatile (untargeted headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry), non-volatile (untargeted reverse-phase ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry), and combined metabolite profiles were used to predict Pinot Noir wine quality ratings as assessed by experts. Non-volatile metabolite profiles predicted wine quality ratings better than volatile metabolite profiles, suggesting that the non-volatile composition of Pinot Noir wines contributes to quality perception to a greater extent than the volatile composition. This was underscored by descriptive sensory analysis, which found that taste and mouthfeel attributes were better correlated with wine quality ratings than aroma attributes. Important predictors of Pinot Noir wine quality were also characterized. Some new relationships between wine metabolites and quality ratings were found: dipeptides and unsaturated fatty acids were positively related to Pinot Noir wine quality, while N-(3-methylbutyl)acetamide and xanthine were negatively associated.

Skeels belonging to family Myrtaceae	NATURAL PRODUCT RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						Syzygium cumini; metabolic profiling; cytotoxic; molecular docking; anti-diabetic	BARK	LC-HR-MS-coupled metabolic profiling of the methanol extracts from different parts of Syzygium cumini (L.), which was extensively identified via DNA fingerprinting, led to dereplication of 24 compounds. Cytotoxic investigation highlighted both extracts as the most potent, against both MCF-7 and MDA-231 Cell lines, with IC50 value of 5.86 +/- 0.63 mu g/ml and against HCT -116 cell line, with IC50 value of 1.24 +/- 0.09 mu g/ml, respectively. A molecular docking study was performed on the dereplicated compounds, which highlighted myricetin-3-glucoside (7), myricitrin (12), reynoutrin (15) and quercitrin (16) as the top scoring ligands within the protein active site (FIH-1). Interestingly, the extracts were significant against streptozotocin-induced diabetes in the order of flowers > seeds > leaves with BGL level of 98.9 +/- 4.3, 123.2 +/- 4.9 and 132.8 +/- 5.9 mg/dl, respectively.

Objectives: Evaluation of the cytotoxic potential of successive fractions of two Aizoaceae plants; Trianthema portulacastrum L. and Aizoon canariense L. against human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cell lines. Moreover, metabolomic profiling of the successive fractions of both plants was carried out. Materials and Methods: Cytotoxic activity of successive fractions of the two plants against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) HepG2 cell lines were evaluated using viability assay, whereas metabolomic profiling was carried out using Liquid Chromatography High-Resolution ElectroSpray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (LC-HR-ESI-MS). Results: Significant cytotoxic activity of the n-hexane and n-butanol extracts of A. canariense (24.7 +/- 3.5 and 55.3 +/- 4.9 mu g/mL, respectively) is recorded. On the other hand, metabolomic profiling of both plants resulted in dereplication of 27 metabolites belonging to different chemical classes; for example, sterols, flavonoids, diterpenes, triterpenes, tetraterpenes, alkaloids, lignans, hydrocarbons, and nucleosides. Phytochemical study of the biologically active fractions resulted in the isolation of one new compound; kaempferol-3-O-(2''-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-6''-O-E-feruloyl-beta-D-glucopyranosid (T1). Biological testing of the isolated compounds indicated significant activity of T1 against HCC (IC50 =7.19 +/- 0.27 mu g/mL). Conclusion: Phytochemicals isolated from T. portulacastrum L and A. canariense L. may be responsible for their cytotoxic activity against HCC HepG2 cell lines.

Early recognition of symptoms is important in the management of psychosis. Therefore, the implementation of molecular biomarkers will be crucial for transforming the currently used diagnostic and therapeutic approach, improving insights into the underlying biological processes and clinical management. Objectives To define a set of metabolites that supports diagnosis or prognosis of schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) at first onset psychosis. Methods Plasma samples from 55 drug-naive patients, 28 SCZ and 27 BD, and 42 healthy controls (HC). All participants underwent a seminaturalistic treatment regimen, clinically evaluated on a weekly basis until achieving clinical remission. All clinical or sociodemographic aspects considered for this study were equivalent between the groups at first-onset psychosis time point. The plasma samples were analyzed by untargeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using reversed-phase and hydrophilic interaction chromatography. The acquired molecular features were analyzed with MetaboAnalyst. Results We identified two patient groups with different metabolite profiles. Both groups are composed of SCZ and BD patients. We found differences between these two groups regarding general symptoms of PANSS score after remission (p = 0.008), and the improvement of general symptoms (delta of the score at remission minus the baseline) (-0.50 vs. -0.33, p = 0.019). Conclusion Our results suggest that plasma metabolite profiles cluster clinical remission phenotypes based on PANSS general psychopathology scores.	[Joaquim, Helena P.

Therefore, we aimed to characterize the differential metabolic signatures resulting from intake of different potato products and identify potential intake biomarkers. In a randomized, controlled, crossover meal study, healthy volunteers consumed boiled rice, boiled potatoes, and two deep-fried potato products, potato chips and French fries. The urine metabolome was acquired by LC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics. Twenty-two selected metabolites were found for deep-fried potatoes, two for potato intake in general, and one for boiled rice. Fourteen of the 22 selected metabolites were tentatively identified as furan-, pyrrole- and pyrazine-derived compounds indicative of Maillard reactions. With further validation, these candidate biomarkers will be important tools to investigate the influence of heated foods on human health.

HIVassociated LVDD may reflect both cardiomyocyte and systemic metabolic derangements, but the underlying pathways remain unclear. Methods and Results--To explore such pathways, we conducted a pilot study in the Bronx and Brooklyn sites of the WIHS (Women's Interagency HIV Study) who participated in concurrent, but separate, metabolomics and echocardiographic ancillary studies. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry-based metabolomic profiling was performed on plasma samples from 125 HIV-infected (43 with LVDD) and 35 HIV-uninfected women (9 with LVDD). Partial least squares discriminant analysis identified polar metabolites and lipids in the glycerophospholipid-metabolism and fatty-acid-oxidation pathways associated with LVDD. After multivariable adjustment, LVDD was significantly associated with higher concentrations of diacylglycerol 30:0 (odds ratio [OR], 1.60, 95% CI [1.01-2.55]); triacylglycerols 46:0 (OR 1.60 [1.04-2.48]), 48:0 (OR 1.63 [1.04-2.54]), 48:1 (OR 1.62 [1.01-2.60]), and 50:0 (OR 1.61 [1.02-2.53]); acylcarnitine C7 (OR 1.88 [1.21-2.92]), C9 (OR 1.99 [1.27-3.13]), and C16 (OR 1.80 [1.13-2.87]); as well as lower concentrations of phosphocholine (OR 0.59 [0.38-0.91]). There was no evidence of effect modification of these relationships by HIV status. Conclusions--In this pilot study, women with or at risk of HIV with LVDD showed alterations in plasma metabolites in the glycerophospholipid-metabolism and fatty-acid-oxidation pathways. Although these findings require replication, they suggest that improved understanding of metabolic perturbations and their potential modification could offer new approaches to prevent cardiac dysfunction in this high-risk group.

An unbiased systems-based approach might help to illustrate the metabolite profiling and underlying pathophysiology. Methods Urine samples were collected from reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome patients and matched controls recruited in Taipei Veterans General Hospital. H-1-Nuclear magnetic resonance was used to initially explore the metabolic profile, and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was then used to identify metabolic alterations in reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome. Untargeted metabolite screening was randomly performed on 10 reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome patients and 10 control subjects in the discovery phase. The selected untargeted metabolites were further validated on 47 reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome patients during their ictal stage (with 40 of them having remission samples) and 47 controls in the replication phase. Results and conclusion Six metabolites-hippurate, citrate, 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid, ascorbic acid, D-glucurono-6,3-lactone, and D-threo-isocitric acid-with t-test derived p-value < 0.05 and VIP score >1, were identified as potential urine signatures that can well distinguish reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome subjects at ictal stage from controls. Among them, citrate, hippurate, ascorbic acid, and D-glucurono-6,3-lactone were significantly lower, and 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid and D-threo-isocitric acid were higher in reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome patients. Of these, four selected metabolites, citrate, D-glucurono-6,3-lactone, ascorbic acid, and 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid, returned to normal levels in remission. These metabolites are related to pathways associated with free radical scavenging, with the hub molecules being associated with endothelial dysfunction or sympathetic overactivity. Whether these metabolites and their implicated networks play a role in the pathogenesis of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome remains to be confirmed.

It is a multifactorial disorder (caused by aging, environmental, and genetic factors). Metabolomics can help explore the biomarker profiles for aging. Recent studies showed an association between the glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) polymorphisms and PD risk. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of this genetic polymorphism and the metabolomic profile in PD Tunisian patients, in order to identify effective biomarkers in the genetic differentiation. Materials and Methods: In this study, the metabolomic profile changes related to GSTs polymorphism were searched in 54 Tunisian PD patients treated with L-dopa, using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique. Results: The study results showed that mannose, methyl stearate, and three other unknown metabolites, increased in patients with GSTM1 positive genotype, while glycolic acid, porphine, monomethyl phosphate, fumaric acid, and three other unknown metabolites decreased in patients with GSTM1 positive genotype. Subsequently, the levels of glycolic acid, erythronic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, fructose, stearic acid, 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol and three other unknown metabolites increased in patients with GSTM1 positive genotype, while the levels of proline, valine and two unknown metabolites decreased with GSTT1 positive genotype. Conclusion: All these altered metabolites are related to energy metabolism and it can be concluded that GSTs polymorphism based the shifting in energy metabolism and led to oxidative stress.

Samples consisted of 39 commercial maca supplements from 11 manufacturers, 31 unprocessed maca tubers grown in Peru and China, and a historic non-tuber maca sample from Peru. Principal component analysis of flow injection mass spectrometry fingerprints initially placed all the maca samples in three classes with similar chemical composition: commercial maca samples, tubers grown in Peru, and tubers grown in China. Metabolite profiling identified 67 compounds in the negative mode and 51 compounds in the positive mode. Compounds identified by metabolite profiling (macamides, glucosinolates, amino acids, fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, saccharides, imidazoles) were then used to identify ions in the flow injection mass spectrometry fingerprints. The tuber fingerprints were analyzed by factorial multivariate analysis of variance revealing that black, red, and yellow maca from Peru and black and yellow maca from China were compositionally different with respect to color and country. Critical ions were identified that allowed for the differentiation of maca between colors from the same country or between two countries with the same color. Genetically, all samples were confirmed to beL. meyeniibased on next generation sequencing at three gene regions (ITS2,psbA, andtrnL) and comparison to recorded sequences of vouchered standards.

However, information on the metabolic dynamics that occur longitudinally through the colon is limited. Here, gas and liquid chromatographies coupled with mass spectrometry were applied to generate metabolic profiles of the region-specific microbial communities cultured using an in vitro platform simulating the ascending (AC), transverse (TC), and descending (DC) colon regions. Comparative analysis revealed a large divergence between metabolic profiles of the AC and the TC and DC regions in terms of short-chain fatty acid production, metabolic spectrum, and conversion of bile acids. Metagenomic evaluation revealed that the regionally derived metabolic profiles had strong correlation to community composition and genetic potential. Together, the results provide key insights regarding the metabolic divergence of the regional communities that are integral to understand the structure-function relationship of the gut microbiota.

Previous studies measuring plasma macromolecular lipids have yielded conflicting results. Purpose: To explore the plasma lipid metabolite profiles by metabolomics analysis and identify potential metabolites associated with cardiac function in acromegaly. Methods: Plasma was obtained from 80 newly diagnosed, untreated patients with acromegaly and 80 healthy controls. Echocardiography was performed. Based on the results of an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), patients were categorized into 2 groups: normal glucose tolerance (NGT, n = 28) and impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes mellitus (IGT/DM, n = 52). High-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS)-based metabolomics analysis was conducted. Data were processed by principal components analysis (PCA), orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), and MetaboAnalyst 4.0. Associations between metabolic substances and cardiovascular parameters were also explored. Results: Metabolomics uncovered a distinct metabolic pattern between acromegaly and healthy controls, and perturbed pathways mainly include glycerophospholipid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, as well as linoleic acid metabolism. Collective analysis showed that phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (22:6/16:0) was positively correlated with LV mass, while lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) (16:0) was positively correlated with fractional shortening (FS) and left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF). Conclusion: Patients with acromegaly have distinct lipid metabolite profiling, while PE (22:6/16:0) and LysoPC (16:0) are correlated with cardiac structure and function, which may contribute to the risk of cardiovascular complications.

Caoxian, as the famous asparagus township in China, enjoys a reputation for producing asparagus with high yield and good quality, due to its unique geological characteristic. In this study, a method of reverse-phase ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (RP-UPLC-ESI-MS/MS) was established for profiling metabolites from three segments (tip, mid, and base) of 'Caoxian white and green Asparagus'. A total of 114 metabolites were identified, among them, 43 were found for the first time in this vegetable. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was applied to provide an overview of the metabolite profiles of Caoxian asparagus and to separate different segments of spears. The variables most decisive to discriminate among segments included 9 of the metabolites tentatively identified. This study will help to improve the protection of Caoxian asparagus geographical indication.

In this study, an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with hybrid triple quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry method was developed to characterize and compare the metabolic profiling of isovitexin experimented on normal and kidney stone model rats. The comparative research indicated that 28 metabolites (18 phase I and 10 phase II) in normal rats and 33 metabolites (20 phase I and 13 phase II) in kidney stone model rats were initially identified. The results of relative quantitative determination reflected that the contents of metabolites produced by deglycosylation, reduction, and isomerization in kidney stone model rats were greater than those in healthy rats. Instead, the levels of oxidative and dehydrogenated metabolites in normal groups were higher than those in kidney stone model groups. The results of this study are valuable and important for understanding the metabolic process of isovitexin in clinical application, and especially the metabolism study in kidney stone model rats could provide a beneficial reference for the further search of effective substances associated with the treatment of kidney stones.

Comparative Metabolic Profiling of Two Contrasting Date Palm Genotypes Under Salinity	PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTER			English	Article						Antioxidants; Date palm; Mechanisms; Metabolomics; Salinity	ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY; PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; LIPID-COMPOSITION; FATTY-ACIDS; STRESS; TOLERANCE; SEEDLINGS; CATECHIN; ROOTS; LEAF	Since specific metabolites may be associated with salinity tolerance, this study aimed to decipher the salinity tolerance mechanism in date palm based on the information encoded by the metabolomic profiles of the salt-tolerant "Umsila" and salt-susceptible "Zabad" cultivars when grown under salinity conditions. Changes in the metabolomic profiles of the leaf and root tissues were determined using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and reverse-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) mass spectrometry. The global untargeted metabolomic analysis showed the presence of 4878 metabolites accumulated in leaf and root tissues of the date palm seedlings. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed the presence of unique groups of metabolites for each treatment and tissue type. Pathway analysis showed the involvement of some of these metabolites in the biosynthesis of several types of membranous lipids and glycolipids molecules such as 18:0-lyso-phosphatidylethanolamine (lysoPE), and also the synthesis of cell-wall components such as 16-hydroxy hexadecanoic acid, which is an intermediate metabolite in cutin, suberin, and wax biosynthesis. Moreover, antioxidant flavonoids such as (+)-catechin and epicatechin, vitamins such as B-9, phytohormone-associated compounds such as dihydrozeatin-9-N-glucoside-O-glucoside, and osmolytes such as the sulfonic amino acid taurine were all significantly (p <= 0.05,FWER <= 0.05) altered in response to salinity in both cultivars. These results indicate that salinity tolerance in date palm involved a multi-dimensional mechanism, which includes the modification of the cell-wall and cellular membranes, the production of oxygen species scavengers, the adjustment of cellular osmotic pressure, and probably the alteration of the hormonal balance. The intracultivar metabolomic profile comparison strategy performed in this study represents an approach that may pave the road toward the identification of salinity tolerance mechanisms in date palm based on the final protein products.

Serum samples were collected from patients with AD (n = 30) and AMCI (n = 32), and normal healthy controls (NOR,n = 40). Metabolite profiles were performed with GC/MS in conjunction with multivariate statistical analysis, and possible biomarker metabolites were identified. Thirty-one kinds of endogenous metabolites could be identified simultaneously. Eleven components were chosen as biomarker metabolites between AD and NOR groups, and these metabolites were closely related to seven biological pathways: arginine and proline metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism,beta-alanine metabolism, primary bile acid synthesis, glutathione metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, and steroid hormone biosynthesis. Meanwhile, 10 components were chosen as biomarker metabolites between AMCI and NOR groups and seven biological pathways were closely related: arginine and proline metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, citrate cycle, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, and steroid hormone biosynthesis. Our study distinguished serum metabotypes between AD, AMCI and NOR patients successfully. The implementation of this metabolomic strategy may help to develop biochemical insight into the metabolic alterations in AD/AMCI and will be helpful for the further understanding of pathogenesis.

Metabolomic profiling of metoprolol hypertension treatment reveals altered gut microbiota-derived urinary metabolites	HUMAN GENOMICS			English	Article						Hypertension; Lisinopril; Metabolomics; Metoprolol	ALPHA-HYDROXYMETOPROLOL; O-DESMETHYLMETOPROLOL; CYP2D6; PLASMA	Introduction Metoprolol succinate is a long-acting beta-blocker prescribed for the management of hypertension (HTN) and other cardiovascular diseases. Metabolomics, the study of end-stage metabolites of upstream biologic processes, yield insight into mechanisms of drug effectiveness and safety. Our aim was to determine metabolomic profiles associated with metoprolol effectiveness for the treatment of hypertension. Methods We performed a prospective pragmatic trial (NCT02293096) that enrolled patients between 30 and 80 years with uncontrolled HTN. Patients were started on metoprolol succinate at a dose based upon systolic blood pressure (SBP). Urine and blood pressure measurements were collected weekly. Individuals with a 10% decline in SBP or heart rate (HR) were considered responsive. Genotype for the CYP2D6 enzyme, the primary metabolic pathway for metoprolol, was evaluated for each subject. Unbiased metabolomic analyses were performed on urine samples using UPLC-QTOF mass spectrometry. Results Urinary metoprolol metabolite ratios are indicative of patient CYP2D6 genotypes. Patients taking metoprolol had significantly higher urinary levels of many gut microbiota-dependent metabolites including hydroxyhippuric acid, hippuric acid, and methyluric acid. Urinary metoprolol metabolite profiles of normal metabolizer (NM) patients more closely correlate to ultra-rapid metabolizer (UM) patients than NM patients. Metabolites did not predict either 10% SBP or HR decline. Conclusion In summary, urinary metabolites predict CYP2D6 genotype in hypertensive patients taking metoprolol. Metoprolol succinate therapy affects the microbiome-derived metabolites.

Comparative Metabolomic Profiling of Rat Embryonic and Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells	STEM CELL REVIEWS AND REPORTS			English	Article						Embryonic stem cells; Induced pluripotent stem cells; Pluripotency; Reprogramming; Rat; Metabolomics; NMR; LC-MS	GROUND-STATE; LC-MS; GLYCOLYSIS; CULTURE	Metabolomic profiles of somatic cells, embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) reflect their metabolic phenotypes. The comparative study of metabolomes of these cells is important for understanding the differences in metabolism between somatic and pluripotent cells, and also the possible differences between ESCs and iPSCs. Here, we performed for the first time the metabolomic analysis of rat ESCs, iPSCs, and embryonic fibroblasts (EFs) at both quantitative and semi-quantitative levels using NMR spectroscopy and liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection, respectively. The total of 106 metabolites has been identified, and the concentrations of 51 compounds have been measured. It is found that the reprogramming of rat EFs into iPSCs affects virtually all metabolic pathways and causes drastic changes in the cell metabolomic profile. The difference between ESCs and iPSCs is much less pronounced: the concentrations of the majority of metabolites in ESCs and iPSCs are similar, and significant differences were observed for only several compounds, including adenosine, cysteic acid, glycerophosphoglycerol, inositol phosphate, glucose,myo-inositol, phosphoserine, xanthosine, guanosine. The observed differences between the metabolomic compositions of ESCs and iPSCs do not influence the pluripotent ability of iPSCs.

Currently, no information regarding the non-targeted metabolome of transgenic tobacco containing recombinant regulatory sequences is available. Objective To compare the proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1-NMR) metabolomics profiling of a recombinant Nicotiana tabacum strain containing a promoter of a sesquiterpene cyclase from Capsicum annuum driving GUS expression, versus wild-type samples. Methodology The non-targeted H-1-NMR metabolome was obtained and processed by principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The differential metabolites were quantified by quantitative NMR. Results PCA and OPLS-DA revealed 37 metabolites including 16 discriminant compounds for transgenic samples. Ethanol (0.4 mg g(-1)), the main differential compound, was exclusively detected in transgenic tobacco; however, high levels of formate (0.28 mg g(-1)) and acetate (0.3 mg g(-1)) were simultaneously observed in the same group of samples. Cembratriene-4,6-diol, an antitumour and neuroprotective compound, and capsidiol, a known phytoalexin, increased by about 30% in transgenic samples. In addition, the endogenous levels of the antioxidant caffeoylquinic acid isomers increased by 50% in comparison to those of wild-type tobaccos. Conclusion Our results support the occurrence of metabolic differences between wild type and transgenic tobacco containing a promoter of a Capsicum sesquiterpene cyclase gene. Interestingly, the recombinant transgenic strain studied accumulated high amounts of added value compounds with biological activity.

Although their toxicity has already been studied and metabolic pathways including important metabolites were described, the quantification of the latter revealed a large unknown portion of the metabolized PA. In this study, the qualitative and quantitative metabolite profiles of structurally different PAs in rat and human liver microsomes were investigated. Between five metabolites for europine and up to 48 metabolites for lasiocarpine were detected. Proposals for the chemical structure of each metabolite were derived based on fragmentation patterns using high-resolution mass spectrometry. The metabolite profiles of the diester PAs showed a relatively good agreement between both species. The metabolic reactions were summarized into three groups: dehydrogenation, oxygenation, and shortening of necic acid(s). While dehydrogenation of the necine base is considered as bioactivation, both other routes are considered as detoxification steps. The most abundant changes found for open chained diesters were dealkylations, while the major metabolic pathway for cyclic diesters was oxygenation especially at the nitrogen atom. In addition, all diester PAs formed several dehydrogenation products, via the insertion of a second double bond in the necine base, including the formation of glutathione conjugates. In rat liver microsomes, all investigated PAs formed dehydropyrrolizidine metabolites with the highest amount formed by lasiocarpine, whereas in human liver microsomes, these metabolites could only be detected for diesters. Our findings demonstrate that an extensive analysis of PA metabolism can provide the basis for a better understanding of PA toxicity and support future risk assessment.

In this research, a novel, sensitive, accurate and rapid liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric method was developed to simultaneously detect the seven active ingredients in rat plasma of Shenkang injection and investigate its pharmacokinetic behaviors with metabolism profiling meanwhile. Methods: For accurate pharmacokinetic quantitation, a WATERS ACQUITY UPLC (R) BEH C18 column was used to perform a separation and acetonitrile-water (0.1% formic acid) was selected as mobile phase for gradient elution with a flow rate of 0.20 mL/min A heated electrospray ionization with selective reaction monitoring mode was used to monitor the precursor-product ion transitions for all the analytes and IS. Results: They all showed good linearity over a wide concentration range (r>0.996 3) and the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 0.1-1.0 ng/mL for analytes. The validation parameters were all within the acceptable limits. Furthermore, for metabolism profiling study, metabolites of the seven ingredients were identified from the rat plasma based on the accurate mass and fragment ions. The metabolic pathways mainly focus on reduction, dehydration and conjugation. Conclusion: This study provided an overview of disposition of Shenkang injection, which is highly instructive for better understanding the effectiveness and toxicity of this drug.

However, excessive N can decrease tuber quality. Furthermore, the impact of optimal and higher N levels of potato tuber metabolic profile at harvest and cold storage remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the metabolic profiling of free amino acids and sugars in potato tubers affected by different nitrogen levels (optimal, ON; and excessive, EN) at harvest (AH) and cold storage (CS) (similar to 4 degrees C, 4 weeks) through untargeted GC-TOF-MS, and targeted UHPLC-QqQ-MS. Carbohydrate content and vacuolar invertase activity (IV) were determined. Principal component analysis of metabolite data indicated a distinct separation between ON and EN treatments at harvest and cold storage. Multivariate data analysis revealed that sucrose, reducing sugars, and free asparagine were the most altered metabolites (VIP > 1 and P < 0.05), which were involved in starch and sucrose metabolism, and alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism. At harvest, the absolute contents of various free amino acids including asparagine were higher (by 1.3-1.5 fold) in the EN treatment than ON treatment, and this difference was maintained at 4-week cold storage. Under the EN treatment, tuber maturity was reduced, and sucrose accumulation was increased at harvest, while IV was increased after cold storage, reducing sugar also accumulated. These results highlighted the negative effects of EN on free amino acid and sugars metabolism in the post-harvest tubers and provided useful information for understanding the underpinning physiological mechanisms.

J	Fu, J; Bae, S				Fu, Jing; Bae, Sungwoo			The pH-dependent toxicity of triclosan on developing zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos using metabolomics	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY			English	Article						Metabolomics; pH; Triclosan exposure; Toxicity; Zebrafish embryos	NMR-BASED METABOLOMICS; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; IONIC-STRENGTH; RESPONSES; WATER; 2,4-DICHLOROPHENOL; BIOACCUMULATION; METABOLISM; MECHANISMS; EXPOSURE	Triclosan (TCS) is commonly used in home and personal care products (HPCPs), which causes it to be ubiquitously detected in aquatic environments. The toxicity of triclosan to aquatic organisms can vary at different pH values because the ionization states of TCS affect its bioaccumulation properties. The objective of this study was to examine the pH-dependent toxicity of TCS on embryonic zebrafish (Danio rerio) using a metabolomic profiling method based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Exposure experiments were conducted on zebrafish embryos at three pH conditions (6, 7, and 8) and two TCS concentrations (30 mu g/L and 300 mu g/L). Metabolic profiles were obtained by extracting intracellular metabolites. Univariate (One-way ANOVA) and multivariate (PLS-DA) analyses were conducted to determine the metabolomic changes in TCS-treated embryos. Changes in the metabolic profile revealed that interference in biological pathways were induced by mostly ionized TCS (low pH) and high TCS concentrations. Also, fold changes in metabolite profiles showed that the TCS toxicity was a function of pH. Metabolites including urea, D-glucose, D-galactose, phenylalanine, L-glutamic acid, citric acid, and phosphoric acid showed significant changes under different pH conditions (p-value < 0.05). Our metabolomics study revealed that the responses of metabolites to TCS toxicity were pH-dependent. The differences of the responses could be attributed to the bioaccumulation capability of TCS, which increased as the ionized TCS proportion increased under low pH conditions.

However, the subsequent functional annotation of these compounds seems arduous because of the largely uncharacterized, vast metabolic repertoire of plant species with known biological phenotypes. Hence, a rapid multi-parallel screening and characterization approach is needed for plant functional metabolites. Results Fifty-one species representing three plant families, namely Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and Rosaceae, were subjected to metabolite profiling using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole orbitrap ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-orbitrap-MS/MS) as well as multivariate analyses. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) of the metabolite profiling datasets indicated a distinct clustered pattern for 51 species depending on plant parts (leaves and stems) and relative phylogeny. Examination of their relative metabolite contents showed that the extracts from Fabaceae plants were abundant in amino acids, fatty acids, and genistein compounds. However, the extracts from Rosaceae had higher levels of catechin and ellagic acid derivatives, whereas those from Asteraceae were higher in kaempferol derivatives and organic acids. Regardless of the different families, aromatic amino acids, branch chain amino acids, chlorogenic acid, flavonoids, and phenylpropanoids related to the shikimate pathway were abundant in leaves. Alternatively, certain amino acids (proline, lysine, and arginine) as well as fatty acids levels were higher in stem extracts. Further, we investigated the associated phenotypes, i.e., antioxidant activities, affected by the observed spatial (leaves and stem) and intra-family metabolomic disparity in the plant extracts. Pearson's correlation analysis indicated that ellagic acid, mannitol, catechin, epicatechin, and quercetin derivatives were positively correlated with antioxidant phenotypes, whereas eriodictyol was positively correlated with tyrosinase inhibition activity. Conclusions This work suggests that metabolite profiling, including multi-parallel approaches and integrated bioassays, may help the expeditious characterization of plant-derived metabolites while simultaneously unraveling their chemodiversity.

Lungs are considered the primary organ affected by PM2.5. In order to understand the mechanismunderlying PM2.5-induced lung injury, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics analysis were conducted to investigate the impact of PM2.5 exposure on lung microbiome and its metabolic profile. Mice were exposed to PM2.5 through intratracheal instillation and a lung injury model was established. 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated that PM2.5 exposure significantly altered the richness, evenness, and composition of the lung microbiome. Metabolomics profiling showed that the levels of lung metabolites were perturbed after PM2.5 exposure. The altered metabolites mainly belonged to metabolic pathways, such as the citrate cycle, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, purine and pyrimidine metabolism, and valine, leucine, and isoleucine metabolism. The altered lung microbiota showed significant correlations with lung metabolites. The levels of fumaric acid negatively correlated with the relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonadaceae. These results revealed that PM2.5 exposure not only significantly altered the lung microbiome composition but also perturbed a number of metabolites involved in diverse metabolic pathways. This study improves our understanding of the mechanism of lung injury after PM2.5 exposure. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Metabolomic profiles were determined for the peel, flesh, and core of the main melon fruit cultivars (cv Andes, cv Grace, and cv Quincy) grown in greenhouses and open fields in the Shonai area of Yamagata Prefecture. As a result, many metabolite concentrations showed high values in the fruit cores. Several amino acids such as GABA and alanine had especially high values, and physiologically active ingredients such as choline, trigonelline, and pyroglutamic acid were also significantly high. In addition, when metabolomic profiles of melon fruits grown in open fields and in greenhouses were compared, those amino acid concentrations tended to be higher in the flesh and cores in the open field cultivation. On the other hand, the core extracts of melon fruits were developed by effectively utilizing fruit processing residues that were discarded in abundance. They showed conspicuously higher concentrations of all amino acids and physiologically active ingredients such as GABA. This approach could be used to design new fruit products through objective evaluation of metabolomics.

The prognosis is pejorative due to the molecular complexity and pathways implicated in leukemogenesis.ObjectivesOur research was focused on comparing the metabolic profiles of leukemic cells in basal culture and deprivation conditions to investigate their behaviors under metabolic stress.MethodsWe performed untargeted metabolomics using H-1 HRMAS-NMR. Five human leukemic cell lines-KG1, K562, HEL, HL60 and OCIAML3-were studied in the basal and nutrient deprivation states. A multivariate analysis of the metabolic profile was performed to find over- or under- expressed metabolites in the different cell lines, depending on the experimental conditions.ResultsIn the basal state, each leukemic cell line exhibited a specific metabolic signature related to the diversity of AML subtypes represented and their phenotypes. When cultured in a serum-free medium, they showed quick metabolic adaptation and continued to proliferate and survive despite the lack of nutrients. Low apoptosis was observed. Increased phosphocholine and glutathione was a common feature of all the observed cell lines, with the maximum increase in these metabolites at 24 h of culture, suggesting the involvement of lipid metabolism and oxidative stress regulators in the survival mechanism developed by the leukemic cells.ConclusionsOur study provides new insights into the metabolic mechanisms in leukemogenesis and suggests a hierarchy of metabolic pathways activated within leukemic cells, some dependent on their genotypes and others conserved among the subtypes but commonly induced under micro-environmental stress.

Highland species are able to tolerate cold stress and lowland species heat stress. Our current understanding on the adaptation or survival mechanisms acquired by the different Nepenthes species to their climatic conditions at the phytochemical level is, however, limited. In this study, we applied an eco-metabolomics approach to identify temperature stressed individual metabolic fingerprints of four Nepenthes species: the lowlanders N. ampullaria, N. rafflesiana and N. northiana, and the highlander N. minima. We hypothesized that distinct metabolite regulation patterns exist between the Nepenthes species due to their adaptation towards different geographical and altitudinal distribution. Our results revealed not only distinct temperature stress induced metabolite fingerprints for each Nepenthes species, but also shared metabolic response and adaptation strategies. The interspecific responses and adaptation of N. rafflesiana and N. northiana likely reflected their natural habitat niches. Moreover, our study also indicates the potential of lowlanders, especially N. ampullaria and N. rafflesiana, to produce metabolites needed to deal with increased temperatures, offering hope for the plant genus and future adaption in times of changing climate.

This study aims to identify altered metabolites from plasma in patients with treatment-requiring ROP (TR-ROP) compared with controls. An untargeted metabolomics analysis was performed to reveal the metabolomic profiles of the plasma between TR-ROP patients (n = 38) and age-matched infants (n = 23). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were conducted to explore the potential signaling pathways of the changed metabolites. Under positive ion mode, a total of 29 metabolites were significantly altered in plasma between TR-ROP patients and controls, and 23 altered metabolites were identified under negative ion mode. KEGG analyses indicated that "protein digestion and absorption" and "aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis" were the most enriched pathways of the altered metabolites. These results demonstrated that metabolomic profiles changed in plasma of TR-ROP, and the altered metabolites could be served as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of TR-ROP patients. Besides, the metabolomic profiles might provide clues to discover novel therapeutic strategies in ROP treatment.

Using solid-phase extraction coupled with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and multivariate data analysis methods, metabolic profiling of the nitrogen-containing compounds was established to distinguish Dendrobium huoshanense and Dendrobium officinale. Hundreds of nitrogen-containing compounds from the two caulis dendrobii were purified by the MCX cartridges. Some compounds were identified by high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry technology. Together with multivariate data analysis methods, comparative analysis of the metabolic profiling from two caulis dendrobii was conducted. A total of 133 nitrogen-containing compounds were identified, including amino acids, pyrrolidines, tropanes, pyrimidines, purines, indoles, piperidines, guanidines, quinolines, isoquinolines and terpenoids. Metabolic profiling analysis showed that the composition and contents of these chemical components were significantly different between D. huoshanense and D. officinale. Moreover, some components were species-specific, distributed in the two caulis dendrobii, such as pilosine, ternatusine, etc. Because alkaloids are mainly derived from amino acids via multistep biochemical reactions, the correlation analysis suggested that amino acids were partially associated with several types of components and significantly correlated with certain alkaloids. Arginine was extremely correlated with guanidines. Pyrimidines, purines and niacin-nicotinamide metabolic intermediates were associated with three independent networks. The results further enriched the chemical components currently identified from caulis dendrobii and provided a technical reference for detecting nitrogen-containing compounds in other medicinal plants.

The metabolic shaping of endophytes on grape cells was reported previously. However, there are no reports on the interactions and metabolic impact of endophyte symbiosis onin vitrovine leaves, which may be examined under well-controlled conditions that are more representative of the natural situation of endophytes within grapevines. The present study used anin vitroleaf method to establish endophyte symbiosis of grapevines and analyze the effects on the metabolic profiles of grape leaves from two different cultivars, 'Rose honey' (RH) and 'Cabernet sauvignon' (CS). The effects of endophytic fungi on the metabolic profiles of grape leaves exhibited host selectivity and fungal strain specificity. Most of the endophytic fungal strains introduced novel metabolites into the two varieties of grape leaves according to the contents of the detected metabolites and composition of metabolites. Strains RH49 and MDR36, with high or moderate symbiosis rates, triggered an increased response in terms of the detected metabolites, and the strains MDR1 and MDR33 suppressed the detected metabolites in CS and RH leaves despite having strong or moderate symbiosis ability. However, the strain RH12 significantly induced the production of novel metabolites in RH leaves due to its high symbiosis ability and suppression of metabolites in CS leaves.

Objective We hypothesize that potassium chloride (KCl) supplementation can improve cardiovascular risk metabolomic profile. Methods In this secondary analysis of a pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT) of 26 participants with prediabetes randomized to KCl or placebo, we performed targeted mass-spectrometry-based metabolomic profiling on baseline and 12-week (end-of-study) plasma samples. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the many correlated metabolites into fewer, independent factors that retain most of the information in the original data. Results Those taking KCl had significant reductions (corresponding to lower cardiovascular risk) in the branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) factor (P = 0.004) and in valine levels (P = 0.02); and non-significant reductions in short-chain acylcarnitines (SCA) factor (P = 0.11). Conclusions KCl supplementation may improve circulating BCAA levels, which may reflect improvements in overall cardiometabolic risk profile.

Mass spectrometry-based metabolomic approach was applied to investigate the differences in volatile and non-volatile metabolite profiles of fermented soybeans by different microorganisms [e.g., molds, yeasts, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), and other bacteria]. The partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) for volatile metabolites profiles indicated that the fungi group (mold/yeast) was clearly discriminated from the bacteria group (bacteria/ LAB). The metabolic pathways related to the formation of volatile metabolites also differed according to microorganisms. In particular, the formation of branched-chain aliphatic alcohols and esters increased in the fungi group, while that of volatiles derived from fatty acids was superior in the bacteria group. In addition, we could determine the microorganism-specific metabolites using a correlation network analysis. This study can provide the fundamental knowledge on the metabolic differences according to the type of microorganisms in fermented soybeans.

Proof of Concept: First Pediatric [C-14]microtracer Study to Create Metabolite Profiles of Midazolam	CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							ACCELERATOR MASS-SPECTROMETRY; DRUG-METABOLISM; ONTOGENY; PHARMACOKINETICS; GLUCURONIDATION; TRANSPORTERS; MICRODOSE; C-14	Growth and development affect drug-metabolizing enzyme activity thus could alter the metabolic profile of a drug. Traditional studies to create metabolite profiles and study the routes of excretion are unethical in children due to the high radioactive burden. To overcome this challenge, we aimed to show the feasibility of an absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) study using a [C-14]midazolam microtracer as proof of concept in children. Twelve stable, critically ill children received an oral [C-14]midazolam microtracer (20 ng/kg; 60 Bq/kg) while receiving intravenous therapeutic midazolam. Blood was sampled up to 24 hours after dosing. A time-averaged plasma pool per patient was prepared reflecting the mean area under the curve plasma level, and subsequently one pool for each age group (0-1 month, 1-6 months, 0.5-2 years, and 2-6 years). For each pool [C-14]levels were quantified by accelerator mass spectrometry, and metabolites identified by high resolution mass spectrometry. Urine and feces (n = 4) were collected up to 72 hours. The approach resulted in sufficient sensitivity to quantify individual metabolites in chromatograms. [C-14]1-OH-midazolam-glucuronide was most abundant in all but one age group, followed by unchanged [C-14]midazolam and [C-14]1-OH-midazolam. The small proportion of unspecified metabolites most probably includes [C-14]midazolam-glucuronide and [C-14]4-OH-midazolam. Excretion was mainly in urine; the total recovery in urine and feces was 77-94%. This first pediatric pilot study makes clear that using a [C-14]midazolam microtracer is feasible and safe to generate metabolite profiles and study recovery in children. This approach is promising for first-in-child studies to delineate age-related variation in drug metabolite profiles.

Differential Metabolic Responses Caused by the Most Important Insect Pest of Coffee Worldwide, the Coffee Berry Borer (Hypothenemus hampei)	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY			English	Article						arabica; la broca del cafe; green coffee seeds; metabolomics; plant-insect interaction; robusta	SUGAR ALCOHOLS; PLANTS; COLEOPTERA; RESISTANCE; STRESS; ACID	The world's coffee supply is threatened by the coffee berry borer, Hypothenemus hampei, the most destructive pest affecting coffee production and quality. This study hypothesized that, coffee berry borer infestation induces distinct metabolic responses in the green coffee seeds of Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora (robusta). A targeted metabolomics approach was conducted using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to quantify intracellular metabolites in infested and uninfested arabica and robusta green seeds. In parallel, the seed biomass content and composition were assessed for the same conditions. Coffee berry borer attack induced increases in the levels of chlorogenic acids in arabica seeds, whereas organic acids and sugar alcohols were more abundant in infested robusta seeds. Most importantly, a set of compounds was identified as biomarkers differentiating the metabolic response of these taxa to the coffee berry borer.

Its hexane extract demonstrated strong antiseizure activity in zebrafish epilepsy assay and was, therefore, selected for bioactivity-guided fractionation. Twelve compounds (1-12) were isolated, and two bioactive phenylbutenoids, trans- (11) and cis-banglene (12), reduced up to 70% of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures. These compounds showed moderate activity against PTZ-induced seizures in a mouse epilepsy assay. To understand the specificity of Z. purpureum active compounds, its chemical profile was compared to that of Z. officinale. Their composition was assessed by differential metabolite profiling visualized by a molecular network, which revealed only vanillin derivatives and terpenoids as common metabolites and gave a comprehensive view of Z. purpureum composition. This study demonstrates the efficacy of a streamlined zebrafish epilepsy assay, which is therefore suitable for routine screening in phytochemistry laboratories.

It is widely used in China to treat sepsis. Previous studies have demonstrated that XBJ can decrease mortality in patients with moderate paraquat poisoning. However, the mechanism by which it exerts this effect is not completely clear. In this study, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS)-based metabolomics approach was used to perform a metabolic profiling analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA), random forest (RF), and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were used to identify metabolites to clarify the mechanism of XBJ's activity. XBJ clearly alleviated lung injury in a Sprague Dawley (SD) rat model of paraquat (PQ) poisoning. Seven metabolites related to four pathways, including those involved in sphingolipid and phospholipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, unsaturated fatty acid metabolism, and pantothenic acid and CoA biosynthesis, were present at different levels in PQ-poisoned rats treated with XBJ compared with untreated rats. XBJ can ameliorate the effects of PQ poisoning in SD rats. Using a metabolomics approach enabled us to gain new insight into the mechanism underlying this effect.

J	Wang, JY; Liu, Y; Liu, CY; Shi, QH				Wang, Jingying; Liu, Yang; Liu, Chunyan; Shi, Qinghong			Characterization of the metabolites of gigantol in rat, dog, monkey, and human hepatocytes using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry	RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY			English	Article							DRUG-METABOLISM; IDENTIFICATION	Rationale Gigantol (3 ',4-dihydroxy-3,5 '-dimethoxybibenzyl) is a bibenzyl compound isolated from Dendrobii Caulis that has been widely used as a medicinal herb in China. To fully understand the mechanism of action of gigantol, it is necessary to determine its metabolic profile. Methods Gigantol at a concentration of 20 mu M was incubated with hepatocytes (rat, dog, monkey, and human) at 37 degrees C. After 120 min incubation, the samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The structures of the metabolites were characterized by their molecular masses, product ions, and retention times. Results A total of 17 metabolites were detected and structurally identified. The metabolism involved the following pathways: (a) oxidation to form quinone-methide species and subsequently conjugation with glutathione (GSH); (b) demethylation to form demethylated gigantol, which was further conjugated with GSH; (c) hydroxylation to yield hydroxyl-gigantol followed by glucuronidation or GSH conjugation; and (d) glucuronidation to form glucuronide conjugates. Glucuronidation was the primary metabolic pathway in all tested species. Conclusions Hydroxylation, demethylation, glucuronidation, and GSH conjugation were the major metabolic pathways of gigantol. This study provides new information on the metabolic profiles of gigantol and helps us understand the disposition of the compound.

Metabolome of Mammary Tumors Differs from Normal Mammary Glands But Is Not Altered by Time-restricted Feeding Under Obesogenic Conditions	ANTICANCER RESEARCH			English	Article						Metabolomics; mammary tumor; MMTV-PyMT; high-fat diet; mice	MICE; TUMORIGENESIS; PROGRESSION; EXPRESSION; MODEL; DIET; CHOLESTEROL; METASTASIS; PROGNOSIS; PATTERNS	Background/Aim: Time restricted feeding (TRF) mitigates the high-fat diet-enhanced mammary tumorigenesis in a MMTV-PyMT breast cancer model. Materials and Methods: We performed untargeted metabolomic and targeted transcriptomic analyses on mammary tumors from MMTV-PyMT mice fed a standard AIN93G diet, a high-fat diet (HFD), or HFD with TRF (12 h, dark phase) and mammary glands from wild-type mice fed the AIN93G diet. Results: The metabolic profile of mammary tumors differed from that of mammary glands; there was no impact of TRF upon tumor metabolome. TRF did reduce elevated expression of Hmgcr, Srebp1, Fads2, and Ppard in mammary tumors, indicating a down-regulation of lipid metabolism. Conclusion: The null effect of TRF on the metabolomic profile does not rule out changes in more refined intracellular signaling pathways. It suggests that the protection of TRF against mammary tumorigenesis may rely upon its action on the host rather than a direct effect on tumor metabolism.

A total of 53 macro-, micro-, trace and toxic elements were simultaneously quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and 24 of them varied significantly between Jize (n = 3) and Korean (n = 3) chilli peppers. In addition, an UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS-based untargeted metabolomics coupled with chemometrics approach was performed to identify potential compounds for the discrimination of Jize (n = 8) and Korean (n = 8) chilli peppers. A panel of 119 metabolites were screened out from the 220 annotated compounds, with the criteria of p <= 0.05, fold changes either >= +2 or <= - 2 and variable importance in projection scores from the PLS-DA models >= 1. Moreover, flavonoids and capsaicinoids were the most important differential compounds between Jize and Korean chilli peppers. Our results demonstrate that Jize and Korean chilli peppers could be clearly distinguished based on their multi-element and metabolite profiles. Results may help to further unravel the candidate bioactive components for the health-promoting effects of chilli peppers.

Although the pathogenesis of UC is multifactorial, growing evidence has demonstrated that gut microbiota and its metabolites are closely related to the development of UC. Lizhong decoction (LZD), a well-known classical Chinese herbal prescription, has been used to clinically treat UC for long time, but its mechanism is not clear. In this study, 16S rRNA gene sequencing combining with untargeted metabolomics profiling was used to investigate how LZD worked. Results indicated that LZD could shape the gut microbiota structure and modify metabolic profiles. The abundance of opportunistic pathogens such as Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Enterobacter, and Escherichia-Shigella correlated with intestinal inflammation markedly decreased, while the levels of beneficial bacteria including Blautia, Muribaculaceae_norank, Prevotellaceae UCG-001, and Ruminiclostridium 9 elevated in various degrees. Additionally, fecal metabolite profiles reflecting microbial activities showed that adenosine, lysoPC(18:0), glycocholic acid, and deoxycholic acid notably decreased, while cholic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, stearidonic acid, and l-tryptophan significantly increased after LZD treatment. Hence, based on the systematic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics of gut flora, the results provided a novel insight that microbiota and its metabolites might be potential targets for revealing the mechanism of LZD on amelioration of UC. Key Points The potential mechanism of LZD on the amelioration of UC was firstly investigated. LZD could significantly shape the structure of gut microbiota. LZD could notably modulate the fecal metabolic profiling of UC mice.

In this work, untargeted Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) metabolomics was used to compare two medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA)-induced mammary carcinomas lines with different metastatic abilities. Different metabolic signatures distinguished the non-metastatic (59-2-HI) and the metastatic (C7-2-HI) lines, with glucose, amino acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism and lipid metabolism as the major affected pathways. Non-metastatic tumours appeared to be characterised by: (a) reduced glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) activities, possibly resulting in slower NADH biosynthesis and reduced mitochondrial transport chain activity and ATP synthesis; (b) glutamate accumulation possibly related to reduced glutathione activity and reduced mTORC1 activity; and (c) a clear shift to lower phosphoscholine/glycerophosphocholine ratios and sphingomyelin levels. Within each tumour line, metabolic profiles also differed significantly between tumours (i.e., mice). Metastatic tumours exhibited marked inter-tumour changes in polar compounds, some suggesting different glycolytic capacities. Such tumours also showed larger intra-tumour variations in metabolites involved in nucleotide and cholesterol/fatty acid metabolism, in tandem with less changes in TCA and phospholipid metabolism, compared to non-metastatic tumours. This study shows the valuable contribution of untargeted NMR metabolomics to characterise tumour metabolism, thus opening enticing opportunities to find metabolic markers related to metastatic ability in endocrine breast cancer.

Its early detection is advisable because 20% of women have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. Objective To clinically validate a metabolomics-based classification algorithm as a screening test for EC. Design, Setting, and Participants This diagnostic study enrolled 2 cohorts. A multicenter prospective cohort, with 50 cases (postmenopausal women with EC; International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage I-III and grade G1-G3) and 70 controls (no EC but matched on age, years from menopause, tobacco use, and comorbidities), was used to train multiple classification models. The accuracy of each trained model was then used as a statistical weight to produce an ensemble machine learning algorithm for testing, which was validated with a subsequent prospective cohort of 1430 postmenopausal women. The study was conducted at the San Giovanni di Dio e Ruggi d'Aragona University Hospital of Salerno (Italy) and Lega Italiana per la Lotta contro i Tumori clinic in Avellino (Italy). Data collection was conducted from January 2018 to February 2019, and analysis was conducted from January to March 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures The presence or absence of EC based on evaluation of the blood metabolome. Metabolites were extracted from dried blood samples from all participants and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A confusion matrix was used to summarize test results. Performance indices included sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and accuracy. Confirmation or exclusion of EC in women with a positive test result was by means of hysteroscopy. Participants with negative results were followed up 1 year after enrollment to investigate the appearance of EC signs. Results The study population consisted of 1550 postmenopausal women. The mean (SD) age was 68.2 (11.7) years for participants with no EC in the training cohort, 69.4 (13.8) years for women with EC in the training cohort, and 59.7 (7.7) years for women in the validation cohort. Application of the ensemble machine learning to the validation cohort resulted in 16 true-positives, 2 false-positives, and 0 false-negatives, and it correctly classified more than 99% of samples. Disease prevalence was 1.12% (16 of 1430). Conclusions and Relevance In this study, dried blood metabolomic profile was used to assess the presence or absence of EC in postmenopausal women not receiving hormonal therapy with greater than 99% accuracy. Question Is combining the blood metabolomic signature of endometrial carcinoma with an ensemble machine learning algorithm a useful system for building a screening test for endometrial cancer? Findings In this diagnostic study that included 1550 postmenopausal women, the proposed screening test correctly identified all 16 women with endometrial cancer, with 2 false-positive results and 0 false-negative results. Meaning The results of this study suggest that the metabolomic profile of a blood sample could provide a noninvasive and accurate screening test with high sensitivity and specificity for endometrial cancer. This diagnostic test validates a metabolomics-based classification algorithm as a screening test for endometrial carcinoma.

In our previous study, GJ-4, a mixture of crocin analogues, was obtained and derived from gardenia fruits. Mainly 18 crocin analogues were identified from GJ-4 and found to exhibit neuroprotective effects inin vitroandin vivomodels. In this present study, we continue to investigate the therapeutic effects of GJ-4 on learning and memory impairments in a 2VO-induced VaD model, and the potential mechanism. In addition, the metabolic profiles and pharmacokinetic properties of GJ-4 were determined using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry after single and multiple oral doses. All these findings presented here will serve as a solid basis to develop GJ-4 as a new therapeutic agent for dementia.

Metabolic profiling of dormant Mycolicibacterium smegmatis cells' reactivation reveals a gradual assembly of metabolic processes	METABOLOMICS			English	Article						Mycobacteria; TB; Mycolicibacterium smegmatis (Mycobacterium smegmatis; M; smegmatis); Dormancy; Metabolomics; Metabolic profiling	MASS-SPECTROMETRY DATA; NON-CULTURABLE CELLS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; IN-VITRO; GROWTH; RESUSCITATION; PERSISTENCE; SURVIVAL; PHASE; MODEL	Introduction Under gradual acidification of the culture medium mycobacterial cells transit into a specific state characterized by low level of metabolic activity and morphological alterations. This state of non-replicative persistence (dormancy) is directly linked to physiological drug resistance, which complicates the efforts to eradicate the latent forms of TB. In order to find new anti-latent TB compounds, the metabolic processes which may occur in the state of dormancy and during the transition into the active state (reactivation) should be characterized. Objectives In the current study we analyzed the untargeted metabolomic profiles of dormant and reactivating Mycolicibacterium smegmatis cells (a model microorganism, bearing many common physiological traits of MTB), on the global scale level, since the characterization and analysis of the metabolites' dynamics would provide a comprehensive overview on global biochemical responses of the bacteria to stress conditions. Methods The reactivation process was tracked by measuring the value of membrane potential, applying a ratio-metric approach, by the method of flow-cytometry. The crucial timepoints were selected and the bacteria were sampled to LC-MS metabolic profiling. Results Reactivation of these cells after 60 days of storage revealed that this process proceeds in two stages: (I) a period, which lasts for 10 h and is characterized by a constant CFU number, unchangeable cell size, a minuscule increase of respiratory activity and a noticeable increase in membrane potential value, indicating the onset of the first metabolic processes during this time interval; the second phase (10-26 h) is characterized by acceleration of endogenous respiration, changes in the size of the cells and it finishes with the beginning of cells division. Analysis of the changes in the relative abundances of KEGG-annotated metabolites revealed that a significant number of metabolites, such as stearic acid, glycerol, d-glucose, trehalose-6-phosphate decrease their concentrations over the reactivation time, whereas in contrast, such metabolites as dodecanoic acid, mycobactin S, and other compounds of PG/AG biosynthesis are synthesized during reactivation. Differential analysis of metabolic profiles disclosed the activation of a number of metabolic pathways at the early reactivation stage: biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, purine and pyrimidine metabolism, glycerophospholipid and fatty acids metabolism etc. Conclusion The data obtained indicate, despite the long-term storage of dormant cells in a state of minimal metabolic activity, according to metabolic profiling, they still retained a large number of metabolites. In the process of reactivation, the incremental stochastic assembly of the complete metabolic pathways occurs.

Thirty-six metabolites were tentatively characterized, belonging to various compound groups such as phenolic glycosides, flavan-3-ols, phenolic acids, terpenes, alkaloids, and aldehydes. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) on the HRMS data matrix resulted in a clear separation of the four cinnamon species. Coumarin, cinnamaldehyde, methoxycinnamaldehyde, cinnamoyl-methoxyphenyl acetate, proanthocyanidins, and other components varied among the four species. Such variations were used to develop a step-by-step strategy for differentiating the four cinnamon species based on their levels of pre-selected components. This study suggests a significant variation in the phytochemical compositions of different cinnamon species, which have a direct influence on cinnamon's health benefit potentials.

There is no consensus on whether enteral support through tube feeding should be preferred. A recent randomized study could not detect any difference between enteral and parenteral feeding with regard to post-transplant outcomes, whereas 2 retrospective studies described an association between enteral feeding and a favorable post-transplant outcome. We compared pre- and post-transplant plasma metabolomic profiles for 10 patients receiving mainly enteral nutritional support and 10 patients receiving mainly parenteral support. Samples were collected before conditioning and 3 weeks post-transplant; 824 metabolites were analyzed using mass spectrometry. The pretransplant metabolite profiles showed a significant overlap between the 2 groups. Post-transplant samples for both patient groups showed an increase of secondary bile acids and endocannabinoids, whereas reduced levels were seen for food preservatives, plasmalogens, and retinol metabolites. The main post-transplant differences between the groups were decreased levels of fatty acids and markers of mitochondrial activation in the control group, indicating that these patients had insufficient energy intake. A significant effect was also seen for heme/bilirubin metabolism for the parenteral support. To conclude,, allotransplant recipients showed altered metabolic profiles early after transplantation; this was mainly due to the conditioning/transplantation/reconstitution, whereas the type of nutritional support had minor effects.

DP for successful aging (SA) has been widely studied. However, the relationship between SA and DP characterized by FIBs still needs further exploration as the candidate markers are scarce. Thus, 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1-NMR)-based urine metabolomics profiling was conducted to identify potential metabolites which can act as specific markers representing DP for SA. Urine sample of nine subjects from each three aging groups, SA, usual aging (UA), and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), were analyzed using the H-1-NMR metabolomic approach. Principal components analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were applied. The association between SA urinary metabolites and its DP was assessed using the Pearson's correlation analysis. The urine of SA subjects was characterized by the greater excretion of citrate, taurine, hypotaurine, serotonin, and melatonin as compared to UA and MCI. These urinary metabolites were associated with alteration in "taurine and hypotaurine metabolism" and "tryptophan metabolism" in SA elderly. Urinary serotonin (r = 0.48, p < 0.05) and melatonin (r = 0.47, p < 0.05) were associated with oat intake. These findings demonstrate that a metabolomic approach may be useful for correlating DP with SA urinary metabolites and for further understanding of SA development.

The components of TCM were absorbed into the circle system as the format of prototypes or metabolites, which contributed to the therapy or side effects. Declaring the functional changes in this process was of great importance to the clinical applications. In this work, an integrated strategy based on metabolites' profiling and network pharmacology was proposed for exploring the pharmacological changes of compounds in vivo. Arctiin, the main component in Fructus Arctii with various kinds of bioactivities, was used as an example. An ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry and metabolynx (TM) software was applied to characterize the metabolites of arctiin in rats at a dosage of 100 mg/kg; network pharmacology was applied to characterize the functional changes. As a result, fifty-three metabolites (32 in plasma, 40 in urine, 19 in bile, 20 in feces, 1 in brain, 12 in liver and 4 in lungs) were screened out and characterized, and 3 of them were unambitiously identified by comparison with standard substances. Among them, 38 metabolites were reported for the first time. It was found the major metabolic pathways of arctiin in rats were demethylation, lactoneopening and phase II conjugations with sulfate and glucuronide. It also confirmed that M14, M15, M18, M23, M22, M43 and M45 were the major circulating forms of arctiin in rats following oral administration. In addition to the above metabolic reactions, phase I reactions of hydrolysis, demethylation, dehydroxylation were also observed, and dehydrogenation were first revealed metabolic patterns of arctiin in rats. Meanwhile, in addition to the main targets of arctiin (MTOR, EGFR and MAPK14), its metabolites targeted additional 392 targets with additional functions of anti-hepatitis B or viral carcinogenesis (SRC, CAPS3, PIK3CA, CDK4, ESR1, MMP9 and ERBB2).

Grapevine variety is composed of clones that share common morphological traits. However, they can differ in minor genetic mutations which often result in not only notorious morphological changes but also in other non-visible sensorial distinctive attributes. In the present work, we identified threeVitis viniferacv. Pinot noir clones grown under identical field conditions that showed different grape cluster types. Here, sensorial analysis together with non-targeted metabolite profiles by Ultra High performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) couples to Ultra High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) of wines elaborated from the three different grape cluster types was studied with the aim of (i) finding sensorial differences among these three types of wines, and, if there were, (ii) determining the molecular features (metabolites) associated with these sensorial attributes by a multivariate statistical approach.

A total of 46 metabolites were identified. Multivariate analysis allowed discrimination of milk from healthy and mastitis cows according to their(1)H-NMR metabolite profiles. Significant increases in acetate, formate, lactate, benzoate, hippurate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, valerate, alanine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine,N-acetylamino acid, phenylalanine, threonine and valine content were associated with extremely high somatic cell count and clinical mastitis status of the cows. Furthermore, significant rises in hippurate, valerate,N-acetylglucosamine, histidine, isoleucine and leucine content could be used as potential biomarker for indicating subclinical mastitis infection of the udders. Beside the existing biomarkers for diagnosing mastitis in literatures, we found additional candidate metabolites, such as alanine, valerate andN-acetylglucosamine, in correlation with mastitis status of Thai crossbred Holstein dairy cows.

This study aimed to classify asthma inflammatory phenotypes based on cellular and metabolic features. Methods: To determine cellular and metabolic profiles, we assessed inflammatory cell markers using flow cytometry, sphingolipid (SL) metabolites using LC-MS/MS, and serum cytokines using ELISA. Targeted gene polymorphisms were determined to identify genetic predispositions related to the asthma inflammatory phenotype. Results: In total, 137 patients with asthma and 20 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled. Distinct cellular and metabolic profiles were found between them; patients with asthma showed increased expressions of inflammatory cell markers and higher levels of SL metabolites compared to HCs (P <.05 for all). Cellular markers (CD66(+) neutrophils, platelet-adherent eosinophils) and SL metabolic markers (C16:0 and C24:0 ceramides) for uncontrolled asthma were also identified; higher levels were observed in uncontrolled asthma compared to controlled asthma (P <.05 for all). Asthmatics patients with higher levels of CD66(+) neutrophils had lower FEV1(%), higher ACQ (but lower AQLO) scores, and higher sphingosine and C16: 0 ceramide levels compared to those with low levels of CD66(+) neutrophils. Asthmatics patients with higher levels of platelet-adherent eosinophils had higher S1P levels compared to those with lower levels of platelet-adherent eosinophils. Patients carrying TT genotype of ORMDL3 h ad m ore CD66(+) neutrophils; those with AG/GG genotypes of SGMS1 exhibited higher platelet-adherent eosinophils. Conclusion: Patients with uncontrolled asthma possess distinct inflammatory phenotypes including increased CD66(+) neutrophils and platelet-adherent eosinophils, with an imbalanced ceramide/S1P rheostat, potentially involving ORMDL3 and SGMS1 gene polymorphisms. Ceramide/S1P synthesis could be targeted to control airway inflammation.

However, the relationship between the biosynthesis of flavonoids as secondary metabolites and sucrose levels remains unknown. To understand the change in flavonoid biosynthesis by sucrose, we conducted secondary metabolite profiling in Melissa officinalis treated with different levels of sucrose using ultraperformance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The partial least squares-discriminant and hierarchical clustering analyses showed significant differences in secondary metabolite profiles in M. officinalis at 50, 150, and 300 mM sucrose levels. The levels of 3 flavonoids such as quercetin 3-O-beta-D-glucosyl-(1 -> 2)-beta-D-glucoside, 6-methoxyaromadendrin 3-O-acetate, and 3-hydroxycoumarin and 19 flavonoids including 6-methoxyaromadendrin 3-O-acetate, aureusidin, iridin, flavonol 3-O-(6-O-malonyl-beta-D-glucoside) quercetin 3-O-glucoside, and rutin increased at 150 and 300 mM sucrose, respectively, compared to 50 mM sucrose, indicating that the flavonoids were accumulated in M. officinalis by a higher concentration of sucrose. This is the first investigation of the change in individual flavonoids as secondary metabolites in M. officinalis by varying sucrose levels, and the results demonstrate that the sucrose causes the accumulation of certain flavonoids as a defense mechanism against osmotic stress.

Fecal Microbial and Metabolic Profiles in Dogs With Acute Diarrhea Receiving Either Fecal Microbiota Transplantation or Oral Metronidazole	FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE			English	Article						metronidazole; fecal micriobiota transplantation; dog; diarrhea; bile acids	BILE-ACID; CLOSTRIDIUM-DIFFICILE; ANTIBIOTIC EXPOSURE; RISK; DYSBIOSIS; INFANCY	The aim was to characterize differences in fecal consistency, and fecal microbiota and metabolome profiles in dogs with acute diarrhea (AD) treated with either fecal microbiota transplantation as enema (FMT; n = 11) or oral metronidazole (MET; n = 7) for 7 days. On days 0, 7, and 28 fecal samples were obtained. Fecal samples from healthy dogs (HC; n = 14) were used for comparison. Samples were analyzed by the previously validated qPCR based canine Dysbiosis Index (DI; increased values indicate microbiota dysbiosis) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The fecal metabolome was analyzed using a previously validated targeted canine assay for fecal unconjugated bile acids, and untargeted metabolomics. Fecal consistency improved significantly in dogs treated with FMT and MET by day 7 and day 28 (p < 0.01) compared to day 0. However, on day 28 fecal consistency was significantly better in FMT compared to MET (p = 0.040). At day 0, dogs with AD had an altered microbiota indicated by significantly increased DI, decreased alpha-diversity, and altered beta-diversity. In the FMT group, the DI decreased over time, while MET led to a significant increase in the dysbiosis index at day 7 and 28 compared to FMT. Sequencing data revealed that in FMT microbial diversity and beta-diversity was similar to HC at day 28, while in MET these parameters were still significantly different from HC. In dogs treated with FMT, a decrease in cholic acid and the percentage of primary bile acids was observed, whereas treatment with metronidazole led to an increase in cholic acid at day 7 and an increase in percentage of primary bile acids over time. Based on untargeted metabolomics, dogs with AD had an altered fecal metabolome compared to HC. Dogs treated with FMT clustered closer to HC at day 28, while dogs treated with MET did not. In this pilot study, dogs with AD had significant differences in fecal microbiota and metabolome profiles. Dogs treated with MET still had altered microbial and metabolic profiles at day 28 compared to dogs treated with FMT or healthy dogs.

Metabolic reprogramming is critical in tumorigenesis, but the metabolic feature of eyelid BCC remains elusive. In this study, we aim to reveal the metabolic profile in eyelid BCC using targeted metabolomics. Eyelid samples were collected from patients who had removal of BCC and from control patients who underwent blepharoplasty. Multivariate analysis of metabolomics data distinguished the two groups, indicating that eyelid BCC has significantly different metabolome than the healthy tissue. We found 16 increased and 11 decreased metabolites in the BCC tissues. These metabolites were highly enriched in the metabolism of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), glutathione metabolism, polyamine metabolism, and the metabolism of glycine, serine, threonine, arginine and proline. amino acid metabolism. Metabolites from NAD metabolism (Nicotinamide; Nicotinamide riboside; N1-Methylnicotinamide) had the highest sensitivity, specificity, and prediction accuracy in a prediction model for eyelid BCC. In conclusion, eyelid BCC has a signature change of cell metabolome. Metabolites in NAD metabolic pathways could potentially be biomarkers or therapeutic targets for eyelid BCC.

Objective To characterize the plasma metabolomic profile in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and prostate cancer (PCa). Methods Metabolomics analyses were performed in plasma samples from individuals classified as non-cancerous control (n = 36), with PIN (n = 16), or PCa (n = 27). Untargeted [26 moieties identified after pre-processing by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)] and targeted [46 amino acids, carbohydrates, organic acids and fatty acids by GC/MS, and 16 nucleosides and amino acids by ultra performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole/mass spectrometry (UPLC-TQ/MS)] analyses were performed. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) concentrations were measured in all samples. In PCa patients, theGleasonscores were determined. Results The metabolites that were best discriminated (p < 0.05, FDR < 0.2) for the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's post-hoc comparing the control versus the PIN and PCa groups included isoleucine, serine, threonine, cysteine, sarcosine, glyceric acid, among several others. PIN was mainly characterized by alterations on steroidogenesis, glycine and serine metabolism, methionine metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism, among others. In the case of PCa, the most predominant metabolic alterations were ubiquinone biosynthesis, catecholamine biosynthesis, thyroid hormone synthesis, porphyrin and purine metabolism. In addition, we identified metabolites that were correlated to the PSA [i.e. hypoxanthine (r = - 0.60, p < 0.05; r = - 0.54, p < 0.01) and uridine (r = - 0.58, p < 0.05; r = - 0.50, p < 0.01) in PIN and PCa groups, respectively] and metabolites that were significantly different in PCa patients with Gleason score < 7 and >= 7 [i.e. arachidonic acid, median (P25-P75) = 883.0 (619.8-956.4) versus 570.8 (505.6-651.8), respectively (p < 0.01)]. Conclusions This human plasma metabolomic assessment contributes to the understanding of the unique metabolic features exhibited in PIN and PCa and provides a list of metabolites that can have the potential to be used as biomarkers for early detection of disease progression and management.

Metabolomics profiling of plasma, urine and saliva after short term training in young professional football players in Saudi Arabia	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							EXERCISE; PERFORMANCE; INTERMITTENT; CITRATE	Metabolomics profiling was carried out to observe the effect of short-term intensive physical activity on the metabolome of young Saudi professional football players. Urine, plasma and saliva were collected on 2 days pre- and post-training. An Orbitrap Exactive mass spectrometer was used to analyze the samples. A reversed-phase (RP) column was used for the analysis of non-polar plasma metabolites, and a ZIC-pHILIC column was used for the analysis of plasma, saliva and urine. mzMine was used to extract the data, and the results were modelled using Simca-P 14.1 software. There was no marked variation in the metabolite profiles between pre day 1 and 2 or between post day 1 and 2 according to principal components analysis (PCA). When orthogonal partial least squares (OPLSDA) modelling was also used, and then models could be fitted based on a total number of metabolites of 75, 16 and 32 for urine, plasma and saliva using hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) and 6 for analysis of plasma with reversed-phase (RP) chromatography respectively. The present study concludes that acylcarnitine may increase post-exercise in football players suggesting that they may burn fat rather than glucose. The levels of carnitine metabolites in plasma post-exercise could provide an important indicator of fitness.

Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) have a long history of treating gout and have some advantages compared with the conventional medicines. Compound TCM Tongfengtai granules are gradually being used for clinical treatment of gout, but its mechanism is still unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore the metabolic profiling of serum from gout patients before and after treatment with Tongfengtai granules and identify the differential metabolites and related metabolic pathways. A total of 40 gout patients hospitalized in Shenzhen Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital from 2018 to March 2019 were recruited in the current study, and serum samples from these patients before and after treatment with Tongfengtai granules were collected. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) assay was used to identify serum metabolites. The OPLS-DA VIP method was used to screen for potential metabolic biomarkers, and MetaboAnalyst 4.0 was used to identify related metabolic pathways. The result showed that there was a significant difference in the concentrations of six metabolites in the serum after treatment: D-galactose, lactic acid, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, D-pyran (type) glucose, alanine, and L-isoleucine. Except D-pyran (type) glucose, the serum concentrations of the other five metabolites were all significantly reduced. Besides, pathway enrichment analysis found that these potential metabolic biomarkers were mainly involved in lactose degradation and the glucose-alanine cycle. Thus, the serum metabolic profiling of gout patients treated with Tongfengtai granules changed, and the differential metabolites and related metabolic pathways might provide clues for understanding the mechanism of Tongfengtai granules.

Alkaloids are the major components in RC, and its curative effect is achieved by oral administration. However, information on its composition in vivo is weak. Methods In this study, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/QTOF-MS) was used to analyze the major active components and their metabolites in rat plasma, urine and feces after oral administration of RC extract. Results A total of 96 compounds including 8 prototype compounds and 88 metabolites were identified, and hydroxylation, reduction, demethylenation, demethylation, dehydrogenation, sulfation, glucuronidation and methylation were the major metabolic pathways. Conclusions This study analyzed metabolic processes of the major active components in RC in vivo, which provided important information for its active composition and in vivo mechanism research. Meanwhile, metabolic profile studies on representative compounds provided valuable reference materials to elucidate the full-scale metabolites of RC.

The results revealed that the aqueous fraction with the latest onset of myoclonic convulsions (1095 +/- 45**** s) was the most biologically active one. This was followed by LC-HR-MS-coupled metabolic profiling which led to dereplication of 8 compounds from that fraction. A molecular docking study was performed on the dereplicated compounds to discover the main responsible ones for the activity. The results highlighted Apigenin-7,4'-di-O-glucoside as the top scoring ligand with a possible mechanism of action involving the modulation of the voltage-gated sodium channel.

This study aimed to identify the molecular underpinnings of altered mitochondrial metabolism in adipocytes. Methods Untargeted proteomics of mitochondria isolated from adipocytes and metabolite profiling of adipose tissues were conducted in diet-induced obese (DIO) and lean mice. Subcutaneous and intra-abdominal adipose tissues were studied to depict depot-specific alterations. Results In subcutaneous adipocytes of DIO mice, changes in proteins related to mitochondrial structure and function were observed. Mitochondrial proteins of the inner and outer membrane were strongly reduced, whereas proteins of key matrix metabolic pathways were increased in the obese versus lean state, as further substantiated by metabolite profiling. A pronounced decrease in the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) enzymatic equipment and cristae density of the inner membrane was identified. In intra-abdominal adipocytes, similar systematic downregulation of the OXPHOS machinery in obesity occurred, but there was no regulation of outer membrane or matrix proteins. Conclusions Protein components of the OXPHOS machinery are systematically downregulated in adipose tissues of DIO mice compared with lean mice. Loss of the mitochondrial OXPHOS capacity in adipocytes may aggravate the development of metabolic disease.

Here, we evaluated the impact of a repeated restraint stress (RRS) paradigm on male Wistar rats and compared global plasma metabolites in stressed and unstressed rats using an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS) approach and multivariate statistical analysis. The data showed that ten days of RRS induced weight loss and anxiety-like behavior, possibly through elevating plasma corticosterone levels in rats. Different metabolic characteristics were found between the two groups. Seventeen differential metabolites were identified and considered as potential biomarkers in the stress process, including histidine metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, and bile acid metabolism. Furthermore, L-carnosine, an identified metabolite, was examined in the same model and found to attenuate weight loss and anxiety-like behavior in RRS rats. Hence, these findings describe the metabolomic profiling of repeated stress and provide new insights into the pathophysiological mechanism of stress-induced deflections and potential pharmacological interventions.

Urine is an ideal biofluid that can be collected non-invasively and contains various metabolite biomarkers. To understand the metabolomic profiles of different stages of CRC, we conducted metabolomic profiling of urinary samples. Capillary electrophoresis-time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to quantify hydrophilic metabolites in 247 subjects with stage 0 to IV CRC or polyps, and healthy controls. The 154 identified and quantified metabolites included metabolites of glycolysis, TCA cycle, amino acids, urea cycle, and polyamine pathways. The concentrations of these metabolites gradually increased with the stage, and samples of CRC stage IV especially showed a large difference compared to other stages. Polyps and CRC also showed different concentration patterns. We also assessed the differentiation ability of these metabolites. A multiple logistic regression model using three metabolites was developed with a randomly designated training dataset and validated using the remaining data to differentiate CRC and polys from healthy controls based on a panel of urinary metabolites. These data highlight the changes in metabolites from early to late stage of CRC and also the differences between CRC and polyps.

Metabolic Signatures Differentiate Rett Syndrome From Unaffected Siblings	FRONTIERS IN INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						urea cycle; neurodevelopmental disorders; biomarker (development); MeCP2; metabolomics (OMICS); rett syndrome; Kreb's cycle enzymes; amino acids	AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; MOUSE MODEL; MECP2; DAMAGE; MUTATIONS; ACID; SEVERITY; DEFECTS	Rett syndrome (RTT, OMIM 312750), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by regression with loss of spoken language and hand skills, development of characteristic hand stereotypies, and gait dysfunction, is primarily caused by de novo mutations in the X-linked gene Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2). Currently, treatment options are limited to symptomatic management, however, reversal of disease phenotype is possible in mouse models by restoration of normal MECP2 gene expression. A significant challenge is the lack of biomarkers of disease state, disease severity, or treatment response. Using a non-targeted metabolomic approach we evaluated metabolite profiles in plasma from thirty-four people with RTT compared to thirty-seven unaffected age- and gender-matched siblings. We identified sixty-six significantly altered metabolites that cluster broadly into amino acid, nitrogen handling, and exogenous substance pathways. RTT disease metabolite and metabolic pathways abnormalities point to evidence of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and alterations in gut microflora. These observed changes provide insight into underlying pathological mechanisms and the foundation for biomarker discovery of disease severity biomarkers.

Hence, biomarkers for ILD are urgently required in RA. Low molecular weight metabolites can be assessed by metabolomic analyses, and although these have been conducted in RA and in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, few have been carried out for ILD in the context of RA. Therefore, we analyzed serum metabolomic profiles of ILD in RA to identify novel biomarkers. Methods: Serum samples from 100 RA patients with ILD and 100 matched RA patients without chronic lung disease (CLD) were collected. These samples were subjected to metabolomic analyses using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Results: A total of 299 metabolites were detected in the metabolomic analysis. By univariate analysis, serum levels of decanoic acid and morpholine were lower in RA with ILD (false discovery rate Q = 1.87 x 10(-11) and 7.09 x 10(-6), respectively), and glycerol was higher (Q = 1.20 x 10(-6)), relative to RA without CLD. Serum levels of these metabolites in RA with usual interstitial pneumonia or RA with non-specific interstitial pneumonia were also altered. The partial least squares-discriminant analysis model generated from these three metabolites could successfully discriminate ILD in RA (area under the curve: 0.919, 95% confidence interval: 0.867-0.968, sensitivity 0.880, specificity 0.780). Conclusions: Serum levels of some metabolites were significantly different in RA with ILD compared with RA without CLD. It is concluded that metabolomic profiling will be useful for discovering candidate screening biomarkers for ILD in RA.

Hyperandrogenism (HA) and insulin resistance (IR) are two important pathogenic factors. Objective We aimed to investigate the inherent disturbed metabolic profiles for women with HA or IR in PCOS as well as discover diagnostic biomarkers. Methods A total of 286 subjects were recruited for the study. They constituted the following groups: healthy women (C), those with HA (B1), those with IR but not obese (B2) and obese women with IR (B3) in PCOS. Nine cross-comparisons with PCOS were performed to characterize metabolic disturbances. Serum metabolomic profiles were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results and conclusion We found a total of 59 differential metabolites. 28 metabolites for B1 vs C, 32 for B2 vs C and 25 for B3 vs C were discovered. Among them, palmitic acid, cholesterol, myo-inositol, d-allose, 1,5-anhydro-d-sorbitol, 1-monopalmitin, 1-monostearin, glycerol 1-phosphate, malic acid and citric acid, were the common differential metabolites among B1 vs C, B2 vs C and B3 vs C, which related to biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, citrate cycle etc. Besides, 9-biomarker panel can diagnose well between HA and IR in PCOS. They provided areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.8511 to 1.000 in the discovery phase, and predictive values of 90% to 92% in the validation set. The result indicated that the differential metabolites can reflect the underlying mechanism of PCOS and serve as biomarkers for complementary diagnosis of HA and IR in PCOS.

We studied the metabolomic profile of gastric cancer (GC) tissue to elucidate the associations between metabolism and recurrence. Methods Cancer and adjacent non-cancerous tissues were obtained in a pair-wise manner from 140 patients with GC who underwent gastrectomy. Frozen tissues were homogenized and analyzed by capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS). Metabolites were further assessed based on the presence or absence of recurrence. Results Ninety-three metabolites were quantified. In cancer tissues, the lactate level was significantly higher and the adenylate energy charge was lower than in non-cancerous tissues. The Asp, beta-Ala, GDP, and Gly levels were significantly lower in patients with recurrence than in those without. Based on ROC analyses to determine the cut-off values of the four metabolites, patients were categorized into groups at high risk and low risk of peritoneal recurrence. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard analyses identified beta-Ala as an independent predictor of peritoneal recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 5.21 [95% confidence interval 1.07-35.89], p = 0.029) and an independent prognostic factor for the overall survival (HR 3.44 [95% CI 1.65-7.14], p < 0.001). Conclusions The metabolomic profiles of cancer tissues differed from those of non-cancerous tissues. In addition, four metabolites were significantly associated with recurrence in GC. beta-Ala was both a significant predictor of peritoneal recurrence and a prognostic factor.

We investigated the association between the metabolic profiles of fasting plasma and the improvement of psychological well-being using non-targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) platform. The metabolic profiles of volunteers participating in the face-to-face intervention group (n = 60) in a randomised lifestyle intervention were compared to ones of controls (n = 64) between baseline and 36-week follow-up. Despite modest differences in metabolic profile between groups, we found associations between phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and several parameters indicating stress, adiposity, relaxation, and recovery. The relief of heart-rate-variability-based stress had positive, while improved indices of recovery and relaxation in the intervention group had an inverse association with the reduction of e.g. lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC). Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist and adiposity correlated positively with the suppressed PCs and negatively with the elevated plasmalogens PC(P-18:0/22:6) and PC(P-18:0/20:4). Also, we found changes in an unknown class of lipids over time regardless of the intervention groups, which also correlated with physiological and psychological markers of stress. The associations between lipid changes with some markers of psychological wellbeing and body composition may suggest the involvement of these lipids in the shared mechanisms between psychological and metabolic health.

All aerial parts of L. japonica (leaf, flower bud, flower, and caulis) are used as herbal remedies in traditional Chinese medicine. The application of plant metabolomics to the study of L. japonica provides the potential for identifying the phytochemical composition and useful chemical markers of the plant. Objective To develop a strategy integrating metabolic profiling and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to separate the aerial parts of L. japonica based on the occurrence of chemical markers. Methodology The two-part strategy consisted of (1) ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry (UFLC-triple TOF-MS/MS), (2) PLS-DA, which was applied to distinguish between the different aerial parts and reveal their differential characteristic metabolites. Results A total of 71 metabolites were identified from samples, and eight candidate compounds were identified (lonicerin, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, loganin, isochlorogenic acid B, isochlorogenic acid C, secologanic acid, luteoloside, astragalin) as optimal chemical markers based on variable importance in projection (VIP) and p-value. The relative contents of eight candidate compounds were compared based on their peak intensities. Conclusion This study established an efficient strategy for exploring metabolite profiling and defining chemical markers among the different aerial parts of L. japonica, and laid the foundation for elucidating the phytochemical differences in efficacy between Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (LJF) and Lonicerae Japonicae Caulis (LJC). Our findings also indicate that the leaves of L. japonica leaf could be used as an alternative medicinal resource for LJF and provide a reference for comprehensive exploitation and utilisation of L. japonica resources.

As such, metabolomic information bears immense potential to improve disease diagnosis and therapeutic drug discovery. Unfortunately, as cohort sizes increase, comprehensive metabolomic profiling becomes costly and logistically difficult to perform at a large scale. To address these difficulties, we tested the feasibility of predicting the metabolites of a microbial community based solely on microbiome sequencing data. Paired microbiome sequencing (16S rRNA gene amplicons, shotgun metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics) and metabolome (mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) datasets were collected from six independent studies spanning multiple diseases. We used these datasets to evaluate two reference-based gene-to-metabolite prediction pipelines and a machine-learning (ML) based metabolic profile prediction approach. With the pre-trained model on over 900 microbiome-metabolome paired samples, the ML approach yielded the most accurate predictions (i.e., highest F1 scores) of metabolite occurrences in the human gut and outperformed reference-based pipelines in predicting differential metabolites between case and control subjects. Our findings demonstrate the possibility of predicting metabolites from microbiome sequencing data, while highlighting certain limitations in detecting differential metabolites, and provide a framework to evaluate metabolite prediction pipelines, which will ultimately facilitate future investigations on microbial metabolites and human health.

Outcomes might be improved by early identification of risk. However, the prognostic information offered is still far from enough. We hypothesized that plasma metabolic profiling potentially provides risk stratification for HF patients. Of 61 patients hospitalized due to acute decompensated HF, 31 developed HF-related events in one year after discharge (Event group), and the other 30 patients did not (Non-event group). The plasma collected during hospital admission was analyzed by an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-TOFMS)-based metabolomic approach. The orthogonal projection to latent structure discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) reveals that the metabolomics profile is able to distinguish between events in HF. Levels of 19 metabolites including acylcarnitines, lysophospholipids, dimethylxanthine, dimethyluric acid, tryptophan, phenylacetylglutamine, and hypoxanthine are significantly different between patients with and without event (p < 0.05). Established risk prediction models of event patients by using receiver operating characteristics analysis reveal that the combination of tetradecenoylcarnitine, dimethylxanthine, phenylacetylglutamine, and hypoxanthine has better discrimination than B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) (AUC 0.871 and 0.602, respectively). These findings suggest that metabolomics-derived metabolic profiling have the potential of identifying patients with high risk of HF-related events and provide insights related to HF outcome.

In this study, we performed Illumina-MiSeq paired-end sequencing for microbial communities and mass spectrometry analysis for metabolite profiling to investigate the differences between 11 traditional meju products from different regions across Korea. Even though the bacterial and fungal communities showed remarkable variety, major genera including Bacillus, Enterococcus, Variovorax, Pediococcus, Weissella, and Aspergillus were detected in every sample of meju. The metabolite profile patterns of the 11 samples were clustered into two main groups: group I (M1-5) and group II (M6-11). The metabolite analysis indicated a relatively higher amino acid content in group I, while group II exhibited higher isoflavone, soyasaponin, and lysophospholipid contents. The bioactivity analysis proved that the ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis (3ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) radical-scavenging activity was higher in group II and the FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) activity was higher in group I. The correlation analysis revealed that the ABTS activity was isoflavonoid, lipid, and soyasaponin related, whereas the FRAP activity was amino acid and flavonoid related. These results suggest that the antioxidant activities of meju are critically influenced by the microbiome and metabolite dynamics.

Herein, we report an untargeted metabolomics analysis to identify circulating thyroid nodule metabolic signatures, to find new novel metabolic biomarkers. Untargeted gas chromatography-quadrupole-mass spectrometry was used to ascertain the specific plasma metabolic changes of thyroid nodule patients, which consisted of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC;n= 19), and multinodular goiter (MNG;n= 16), as compared to healthy subjects (n= 20). Diagnostic models were constructed using multivariate analyses such as principal component analysis, orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis, and univariate analysis including One-way ANOVA and volcano plot by MetaboAnalyst and SIMCA software. Because of the multiple-testing issue, false discovery ratep-values were also computed for these functions. A total of 60 structurally annotated metabolites were subjected to statistical analysis. A combination of univariate and multivariate statistical analyses revealed a panel of metabolites responsible for the discrimination between thyroid nodules and healthy subjects, with variable importance in the projection (VIP) value greater than 0.8 andp-value less than 0.05. Significantly altered metabolites between thyroid nodules versus healthy persons are those associated with amino acids metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, fatty acids, and purine and pyrimidine metabolism, including cysteine, cystine, glutamic acid, alpha-ketoglutarate, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, adenosine-5-monophosphate, and uracil, respectively. Further, sucrose metabolism differed profoundly between thyroid nodule patients and healthy subjects. Moreover, according to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, sucrose could discriminate PTC from MNG (area under ROC curve value = 0.92). This study enhanced our understanding of the distinct metabolic pathways associated with thyroid nodules, which enabled us to distinguish between patients and healthy subjects. In addition, our study showed extensive sucrose metabolism in the plasma of thyroid nodule patients, which provides a new metabolic signature of the thyroid nodule's tumorigenesis. Accordingly, it suggests that sucrose can be considered as a circulating biomarker for differential diagnosis between malignancy and benignity in indeterminate thyroid nodules.

LC-MS/MS-based metabolic profiling of Escherichia coli under heterologous gene expression stress	JOURNAL OF CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						metabolic profiling; ampicillin resistance; gene expression; E; coli; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; mass spectrometry	CARBON; ACID	Escherichia coli is frequently exploited for genetic manipulations and heterologous gene expression studies. We have evaluated the metabolic profile of E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) RIL CodonPlus after genetic modifications and subjecting to the production of recombinant protein. Three genetically variable E. coli cell types were studied, normal cells (susceptible to antibiotics) cultured in simple LB medium, cells harboring ampicillin-resistant plasmid pET21a (+), grown under antibiotic stress, and cells having recombinant plasmid pET21a (+) ligated with bacterial lactate dehydrogenase gene grown under ampicillin and standard isopropyl thiogalactoside (IPTG)-induced gene expression conditions. A total of 592 metabolites were identified through liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry analysis, feature and peak detection using XCMS and CAMERA followed by precursor identification by METLIN-based procedures. Overall, 107 metabolites were found differentially regulated among genetically modified cells. Quantitative analysis has shown a significant modulation in DHNA-CoA, p-aminobenzoic acid, and citrulline levels, indicating an alteration in vitamin K, folic acid biosynthesis, and urea cycle of E. coli cells during heterologous gene expression. Modulations in energy metabolites including NADH, AMP, ADP, ATP, carbohydrate, terpenoids, fatty acid metabolites, diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A), and l-carnitine advocate major metabolic rearrangements. Our study provides a broader insight into the metabolic adaptations of bacterial cells during gene manipulation experiments that can be prolonged to improve the yield of heterologous gene products and concomitant production of valuable biomolecules.

Populations of Populus angustifolia have evolved distinct metabolic profiles that influence their surrounding soil	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						Co-inertia; Distance based redundancy analysis; LC-MS; Metabolomics; Orbitrap; Plant conditioning; Rhizosphere; Van Krevelen diagrams	PLANT; ECOSYSTEM; FEEDBACK; DYNAMICS; DECOMPOSITION; TRICHOCARPA; COMMUNITY; RESPONSES; DEFENSE; SIGNALS	Aims Plant-microbial-soil interactions are key to understanding plant community succession, invasion success, patterns of biodiversity and aspects of ecosystem function. Yet root and rhizosphere chemistry is highly complex, and little is known about natural variation across environmental gradients. Variation in tree species root chemical phenotypes should alter how rhizosphere microbes respond, showing a plant conditioning effect on the chemical makeup of the soil. Here, we used metabolomics to assess bulk small molecule profiles addressing the hypothesis that genetic variation across a species range would result in varying metabolic profiles in roots and surrounding soil. Methods Using UPLC-HRMS we assessed the small molecule profile of root tissue and surrounding rhizosphere soil from 5-year old plant clones collected from six populations of Populus angustifolia across the western U.S., grown in a common environment. Results Population-level variation was found in over 12,000 root metabolomes and over 5000 soil organic compounds across the populations. Redundancy analysis of over twelve thousand metabolites suggests that plant population origin can account for up to 36% of the variation in roots and 30% of the variation in rhizosphere soil chemistry. Co-inertia analysis indicates that variation in root metabolite profiles explains 15% of the variation in paired soil samples. Conclusion Distinct populations have evolved different root tissue metabolomes. The difference in root metabolites across populations altered the rhizosphere soil composition, creating variable soil chemical communities from a homogenous starting condition. This suggests that intra-specific plant conditioning of soil varies by plant population.

Currently, the measurement of immuno reactive trypsinogen in dry blood spots (DBSs) is the gold-standard method for initial newborn screening for CF, followed by targeted CF transmembrane regulator (CFTR) mutation analysis, and ultimate confirmation with abnormally elevated sweat chloride. Previous metabolomics studies in patients with CF reported on different biomarkers such as breath 2-aminoacetophenone produced during acute and chronic infection in human tissues, including the lungs of CF patients. Herein, we used liquid and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based targeted metabolomics profiling to identify potentially reliable, sensitive, and specific biomarkers in DBSs collected from 69 young and adult people including CF patients (n = 39) and healthy control (n 30). A distinctive metabolic profile including 26 significantly differentially expressed metabolites involving amino acids, glycolysis, mitochondrial and peroxisomal metabolism, and sorbitol pathways was identified. Specifically, the osmolyte (sorbitol) was remarkably downregulated in CF patients compared to healthy controls indicating perturbation in the sorbitol pathway, which may be responsible for the mucoviscidosis seen in patients with CF. The significance of our findings is supported by the clinical utility of inhaled mannitol and hypertonic saline in patients with CF. The systemic administration of sorbitol in such patients may confer additional benefits beyond the respiratory system, especially in those with misfolded CFTR proteins.

Herein, we performed an in-depth characterization of the metabolic behavior of MSCs derived from the placenta, umbilical cord, and adipose tissue (termed hPMSCs, UC-MSCs, and AD-MSCs, respectively) at physiological (hypoxic; 5% oxygen [O-2]) and standardized (normoxic; 21% O-2) O-2 concentrations using chemical isotope labeling liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. C-12- and C-13-isotope dansylation (Dns) labeling was used to analyze the amine/phenol submetabolome, and 2574 peak pairs or metabolites were detected and quantified, from which 52 metabolites were positively identified using a library of 275 Dns-metabolite standards; 2189 metabolites were putatively identified. Next, we identified six metabolites using the Dns library, as well as 14 hypoxic biomarkers from the human metabolome database out of 96 altered metabolites. Ultimately, metabolic pathway analyses were performed to evaluate the associated pathways. Based on pathways identified using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, we identified significant changes in the metabolic profiles of MSCs in response to different O-2 concentrations. These results collectively suggest that O-2 concentration has the strongest influence on hPMSCs metabolic characteristics, and that 5% O-2 promotes arginine and proline metabolism in hPMSCs and UC-MSCs but decreases gluconeogenesis (alanine-glucose) rates in hPMSCs and AD-MSCs. These changes indicate that MSCs derived from different sources exhibit distinct metabolic profiles.

However, about 20-40% of DKD is normoalbuminuric DKD (NADKD), which has impaired kidney function but normal urine albumin. This study is to investigate the urine metabolomic profiles of patients with NADKD and albuminuria DKD (ADKD). Methods In total, 95 patients were divided into a simple diabetes mellitus group (SDM group), an ADKD group, and a NADKD group. All subjects were analyzed for urine metabolites using non-targeted metabolomics based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry. Results The urine metabolomic profiles of the SDM group, NADKD group, and ADKD group were significantly different, and 65 different metabolites were identified among the three groups. Metabolic pathway analysis of these differential metabolites found that the top three significantly changed metabolic pathways were linoleic acid metabolism, citrate cycle, and, arginine and proline metabolism. There are 12 metabolites enriched in these three metabolic pathways. In detail, compared with those in the SDM group, the levels of gamma-linolenic acid in the ADKD group were increased significantly, while the levels of succinic acid,cis-aconitic acid, citric acid,L-proline,L-erythro-4-hydroxyglutamate,N-methylhydantoin,N-carbamoylputrescine, spermidine, and 5-aminopentanoic acid were reduced significantly; compared with those in the NADKD group, the levels of linoleic acid, gamma-linolenic acid, andL-malic acid in the ADKD group were increased significantly (P< 0.05), while the levels ofL-proline,L-erythro-4-hydroxyglutamate,N-carbamoylputrescine, and spermidine were significantly reduced (P< 0.05). However, there were no significant difference between the SDM group and NADKD group (P> 0.05). Conclusion The urine metabolomic profiles between the NADKD group and the ADKD group are significantly different. Specifically, these two groups have distinct levels of linoleic acid, gamma-linolenic acid,L-malic acid,L-proline,L-erythro-4-hydroxyglutamate,N-carbamoylputrescine, and spermidine.

Childhood severe acute malnutrition is associated with metabolic changes in adulthood	JCI INSIGHT			English	Article							SERUM-INSULIN RESPONSE; DEVELOPMENTAL ORIGINS; BODY-COMPOSITION; GLUCOSE; CHILDREN; GROWTH; LIVER; SURVIVORS; DISEASE; RISK	BACKGROUND. Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is a major contributor to global mortality in children under 5 years. Mortality has decreased; however, the long-term cardiometabolic consequences of SAM and its subtypes, severe wasting (SW) and edematous malnutrition (EM), are not well understood. We evaluated the metabolic profiles of adult SAM survivors using targeted metabolomic analyses. METHODS. This cohort study of 122 adult SAM survivors (SW = 69, EM = 53) and 90 age-, sex-, and BMI-matched community participants (CPs) quantified serum metabolites using direct flow injection mass spectrometry combined with reverse-phase liquid chromatography. Univariate and sparse partial least square discriminant analyses (sPLS-DAs) assessed differences in metabolic profiles and identified the most discriminative metabolites. RESULTS. Seventy-seven metabolite variables were significant in distinguishing between SAM survivors (28.4 +/- 8.8 years, 24.0 +/- 6.1 kg/m(2)) and CPs (28.4 +/- 8.9 years, 233 +/- 4.4 kg/m(2)) (mean +/- SDs) in univariate and sPLS-DA models. Compared with CPs, SAM survivors had less liver fat; higher branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), urea cycle metabolites, and kynurenine/tryptophan (KT) ratio (P < 0.001); and lower p-hydroxybutyric acid and acylcarnitine/free carnitine ratio (P < 0.001), which were both associated with hepatic steatosis (P < 0.001). SW and EM survivors had similar metabolic profiles as did stunted and nonstunted SAM survivors. CONCLUSION. Adult SAM survivors have distinct metabolic profiles that suggest reduced beta-oxidation and greater risk of type 2 diabetes (BCAAs, KT ratio, urea cycle metabolites) compared with CPs. This indicates that early childhood SAM exposure has long-term metabolic consequences that may worsen with age and require targeted clinical management.

Metabolic profiling by reversed-phase/ion-exchange mass spectrometry	JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY B-ANALYTICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN THE BIOMEDICAL AND LIFE SCIENCES			English	Article						Liquid chromatography; Ion-exchange; Mass spectrometry; Metabolomics; Reversed-phase	INTERACTION LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; HYDROPHILIC INTERACTION; HIGH-THROUGHPUT; LARGE-SCALE; POLAR; PLASMA; MS; OPTIMIZATION; URINE; SERUM	Metabolic profiling is commonly achieved by mass spectrometry (MS) following reversed-phase (RP) and hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) either performed independently, leading to overlapping datasets, or in a coupled configuration, requiring multiple liquid chromatography (LC) systems. To overcome these limitations, we developed a single, 20-minute chromatographic method using an in-line RP-ion-exchange (IEX) column arrangement and a single LC system. This configuration separates clinically significant polar and nonpolar compounds without derivatization or ion-pairing reagents, allowing ionization in both polarities. An inhouse library was created with 397 authentic standards, including acylcarnitines, amino acids, bile acids, nucleosides, organic acids, steroid hormones, and vitamins. Analysis of pooled plasma and urine samples revealed 5445 and 4111 ion features, leading to 88 and 82 confirmed metabolite identifications, respectively. Metabolites were detected at clinically relevant concentrations with good precision, and good chromatographic separation was demonstrated for clinically significant isomers including methylmalonic acid and succinic acid, as well as alloisoleucine and isoleucine/leucine. Evaluation of the samples by unsupervised principal component analysis showed excellent analytical quality.

Efforts to improve its early and accurate diagnosis are largely based on preclinical models and especially cell lines. Hence, we herein present a combinational Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)- and Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography-High-Resolution Tandem Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS/MS)-mediated untargeted metabolomic profiling of melanoma cells, to landscape metabolic alterations likely controlling metastasis. The cell lines WM115 and WM2664, which belong to the same patient, were examined, with WM115 being derived from a primary, pre-metastatic, tumor and WM2664 clonally expanded from lymph-node metastases. Metabolite samples were analyzed using NMR and UHPLC-HRMS. Multivariate statistical analysis of high resolution NMR and MS (positive and negative ionization) results was performed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) and Orthogonal Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA), while metastasis-related biomarkers were determined on the basis of VIP lists, S-plots and Student's t-tests. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves of NMR and MS data revealed significantly differentiated metabolite profiles for each cell line, with WM115 being mainly characterized by upregulated levels of phosphocholine, choline, guanosine and inosine. Interestingly, WM2664 showed notably increased contents of hypoxanthine, myo-inositol, glutamic acid, organic acids, purines, pyrimidines, AMP, ADP, ATP and UDP(s), thus indicating the critical roles of purine, pyrimidine and amino acid metabolism during human melanoma metastasis.

In an attempt to prevent fraud issues and ensure quality, the International Olive Council (IOC) issued guidelines for their sensory evaluation. However, certain varieties, geographical origins and processing parameters are omitted. The aim of the present study was the development of a method for the quality assessment of edible olives from the Konservolia, Kalamon and Chalkidikis cultivars from different areas of Greece processed with the Spanish or Greek method. A rapid NMR-based untargeted metabolic profiling method was developed along with multivariate analysis (MVA) and applied for the first time in edible olives' analysis complemented by the aid of statistical total correlation spectroscopy (STOCSY). Specific biomarkers, related to the classification of olives based on different treatments, cultivars and geographical origin, were identified. STOCSY proved to be a valuable aid towards the assignment of biomarkers, a bottleneck in untargeted metabolomic approaches.

Although LDA is highly associated with metabolic disturbances, the related information on comprehensive metabolic changes, with the exception of some blood biochemical parameters, remains limited. In this study, the changes in plasma metabolites and in the metabolic profile of postpartum dairy cows with LDA were investigated through liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q/TOF-MS)-based metabolomics, and the metabolic networks related to LDA were constructed through metabolomics pathway analysis (MetPA). An obvious change in the metabolic profile was reflected by significant variations in 68 plasma metabolites in postpartum dairy cows with LDA, and these variations consequently altered 13 metabolic pathways (histidine metabolism, tyrosine metabolism, valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, arginine and proline metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies, linoleic acid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, citrate cycle, butanoate metabolism, vitamin B-6 metabolism and pyrimidine metabolism). This study shows that the more detailed information obtained by LC-Q/TOF-MS-based metabolomics and MetPA might contribute to a better understanding of the disordered metabolic networks in postpartum dairy cows with LDA.

The Haber-Bosch process, which is the main method for producing ammonia, can produce ammonia with high efficiency. However, since it consumes a large amount of fossil energy, it is necessary to develop an alternative method for producing ammonia with less environmental impact. Ammonia production from food by-products is an appealing production process owing to unused resource usage, including waste, and mild reaction conditions. However, when food by-products and biomass are used as feedstocks, impurities often reduce productivity. Using metabolic profiling, glucose was identified as a potential inhibitor of ammonia production from impure food by-products. We constructed the recombinantEscherichia coli, in which glucose uptake was reduced byptsGgene disruption and amino acid catabolism was promoted byglnAgene disruption. Ammonia production efficiency from okara, a food by-product, was improved in this strain; 35.4 mM ammonia was produced (47% yield). This study might provide a strategy for efficient ammonia production from food by-products.

The behavioral variant (bvFTD) is the most clinical common form and requires differential diagnosis with atypical Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases. This study aimed to investigate the plasma metabolite profile of patients with bvFTD compared to AD patients and cognitively healthy individuals using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC MS). This study included nine patients with bvFTD, 17 with AD and 15 cognitively healthy controls (training set), whose data were validated on a testing set (eight bvFTD, 14 AD and ten controls). The metabolites were detected by GC MS. A tendency towards a reduction in the levels of palmitoleic, oleic and lauric acids was found in the bvFTD group compared to the AD group; however, no significance after multiple comparison correction was observed. However, bvFTD group showed reduced levels of creatinine, glycine, tryptophan, uric acid, hypoxanthine, serine, valine, threonine, isoleucine, homoserine, methionine, glutamic acid, capric acid, tartronic acid, fumaric acid, and myo-inositol, metabolites related to glycine/serine/threonine, alanine/aspartate/glutamate pathways and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, when compared to controls. The data suggest that bvFTD patients may present an impairment of amino acid metabolism and the translation process. This pioneering study on bvFTD and its plasma metabolomic signature can be useful to provide new ideas about pathophysiological mechanisms, as well as guide more robust studies in search of possible biomarkers for the diagnosis of this important dementia.

Metabolomics Fingerprint Induced by the Intranigral Inoculation of Exogenous Human Alpha-Synuclein Oligomers in a Rat Model of Parkinson's Disease	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES			English	Article						&#945; -synuclein oligomers; Parkinson model; metabolomics; mesencephalic tissue; serum; gas chromatography mass spectrometry; biomarkers	CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; PROTEIN OLIGOMERS; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; OXIDATIVE STRESS; COMPLEX-I; TOXICITY; GLUTATHIONE; BRAIN; CSF; ACCUMULATION	Parkinson's disease (PD) is considered a synucleinopathy because of the intraneuronal accumulation of aggregated alpha-synuclein (alpha Syn). Recent evidence points to soluble alpha Syn-oligomers (alpha SynO) as the main cytotoxic species responsible for cell death. Given the pivotal role of alpha Syn in PD, alpha Syn-based models are crucial for the investigation of toxic mechanisms and the identification of new therapeutic targets in PD. By using a metabolomics approach, we evaluated the metabolic profile of brain and serum samples of rats infused unilaterally with preformed human alpha SynOs (H alpha SynOs), or vehicle, into the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Three months postinfusion, the striatum was dissected for striatal dopamine (DA) measurements via High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis and mesencephalon and serum samples were collected for the evaluation of metabolite content via gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. Multivariate, univariate and correlation statistics were applied. A 40% decrease of DA content was measured in the H alpha SynO-infused striatum as compared to the contralateral and the vehicle-infused striata. Decreased levels of dehydroascorbic acid, myo-inositol, and glycine, and increased levels of threonine, were found in the mesencephalon, while increased contents of fructose and mannose, and a decrease in glycine and urea, were found in the serum of H alpha SynO-infused rats. The significant correlation between DA and metabolite content indicated that metabolic variations reflected the nigrostriatal degeneration. Collectively, the metabolomic fingerprint of H alpha SynO-infused rats points to an increase of oxidative stress markers, in line with PD neuropathology, and provides hints for potential biomarkers of PD.

IMF measurements are currently impractical without a labor-intensive process. Metabolomic profiling could be used as an IMF indicator to avoid this process; however, no studies have investigated their use during the fattening period of pigs. This study examined the metabolite profiles in the plasma of two groups of pigs derived from the same Duroc genetic line and fed the same diet. Five plasma samples were collected from each individual the day before slaughter. Capillary electrophoresis-time of flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS) was used to analyze the purified plasma from each sample. Principle component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) were used to find the semi-quantitative values of the compounds. The results indicate that branched-chain amino acids are significantly associated with high IMF content, while amino acids are associated with low IMF content. These differences were validated using the quantification analyses by high-performance liquid chromatograph, which supported our results. These results suggest that the concentration of branched-chain amino acids in plasma could be an indicative biomarker for the IMF content in the loin eye area.

Oral squamous cell carcinoma diagnosed from saliva metabolic profiling	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						point-of-care test; noninvasive diagnosis; conducting polymer spray ionization; salivary metabolomics; oral squamous cell carcinoma	TRANSFER-RNA SYNTHETASES; PROTEIN BIOMARKERS; CANCER	Saliva is a noninvasive biofluid that can contain metabolite signatures of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Conductive polymer spray ionization mass spectrometry (CPSI-MS) is employed to record a wide range of metabolite species within a few seconds, making this technique appealing as a point-of-care method for the early detection of OSCC. Saliva samples from 373 volunteers, 124 who are healthy, 124 who have premalignant lesions, and 125 who are OSCC patients, were collected for discovering and validating dysregulated metabolites and determining altered metabolic path-ways. Metabolite markers were reconfirmed at the primary tissue level by desorption electrospray ionization MS imaging (DESI-MSI), demonstrating the reliability of diagnoses based on saliva metabo-lomics. With the aid of machine learning (ML), OSCC and premalignant lesions can be distinguished from the normal physical condition in real time with an accuracy of 86.7%, on a person by person basis. These results suggest that the combination of CPSI-MS and ML is a feasible tool for accurate, automated diagnosis of OSCC in clinical practice.

Metabolite profiling of three Opuntia ficus-indica fruit cultivars using UPLC-QTOF-MS in relation to their antioxidant potential	FOOD BIOSCIENCE			English	Article						Opuntia ficus-Indica; Isorhamnetin; Coumarin; Chemometrics; Dihydroxy psoralen-O-Hexoside	FINGERPRINT; FLOWERS	Opuntia ficus-indica is the economically important cactus species belonging to the Cactaceae family. Its importance arises from its nutritional value and various biological activities such as antioxidant, anticancer and antimicrobial activities. This study attempts to characterize the metabolic profile of three O. ficus cultivars having different colors, i.e., red 'Rose', greenish white 'Bianca' and yellow-orange represented by peels and pulp tissues using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS). A total of 45 metabolites were identified mainly flavonoids: isorhamnetin conjugates and phenolic acids, whereas betaxanthins and coumarins were present at lower levels. Principle component analysis and orthogonal projection discriminant analysis showed that dihydroxy psoralen-O-hexoside and glycosidic conjugates of ferulic acid were the most discriminatory metabolites among the peels and pulps within the different cultivars. On the other hand, the level of flavonoids was comparable among the cultivars. The antioxidant activity of peels and pulps extracts were further measured using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) assays. "Rose'' cultivar peel rich in dihydroxy psoralen-O-hexoside showed the highest antioxidant activity in both assays. This suggested that coumarins and flavonoids mediated high antioxidant activity of O. ficus-indica fruits although present at low levels.

We previously reported that administration of a diet rich in black raspberry (BRB) changed the com position and diverse functional pathways in the mouse gut microbiome. To further characterize the functional profile in the gut microbiome of mice on BRB diet, in this follow-up study, we examined the metabolome differences in the gut microbiome driven by BRB consumption via targeted and untargeted metabolomic approaches. A distinct metabolite profile was observed in the gut m icrobiome of the mice on BRB diet, likely resulting from a combination of microbiome functional changes and unique precursors in BRBs. A number of functional metabolites, such as tetrahydrobiopterin and butyrate that were significantly increased in the gut microbiome may be linked to the beneficial health effects of BRB consumption. These findings suggest the important role of the gut microbiome in the health effects of BRB s and provide a connection among the health benefits of functional foods and the gut microbiome.

The CSF samples obtained from 64 patients were analyzed by GC-MS/MS. Multivariate analyses were performed for two age groups, 0-5 years of age and 6-17 years of age, to elucidate the effects of epilepsy and antiepileptic drugs on the metabolites. In patients aged 0-5 years (22 patients with epilepsy, 13 without epilepsy), epilepsy patients had reduced 2-ketoglutaric acid and elevated pyridoxamine and tyrosine. In patients aged 6-17 years (12 with epilepsy, 17 without epilepsy), epilepsy patients had reduced 1,5-anhydroglucitol. Valproic acid was associated with elevated 2-aminobutyric acid, 2-ketoisocaproic acid, 4-hydroxyproline, acetylglycine, methionine, N-acetylserine, and serine. Reduced energy metabolism and alteration of vitamin B6 metabolism may play a role in epilepsy in young children. The roles of 1,5-anhydroglucitol in epilepsy in older children and in levetiracetam and zonisamide treatment remain to be explained. Valproic acid influenced the levels of amino acids and related metabolites involved in the metabolism of serine, methionine, and leucine.

Metabolomics approaches are widely employed in the study of cancer, nutrition/diet, diabetes, and other physiological and pathological conditions involving metabolic processes. An advantageous tool that aids in metabolomic profiling advocated in this paper is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI). Its ability to detect metabolites in situ without labeling, structural modifications, or other specialized reagents, such as those used in immunostaining, makes MALDI MSI a unique tool in advancing methodologies relevant in the field of metabolomics. An appropriate sample preparation process is critical to yield optimal results and will be the focus of this paper.

However, relatively few studies focus on metabolic feature of PQ intoxication for investigating the underlying mechanisms. Here we performed non-targeted metabolomics profiling of serum samples from acute and chronic PQ intoxicated mouse models by gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF/MS) to identify metabolic feature and characteristic metabolites of acute and chronic PQ intoxication. Results showed that 3-indolepropionic acid (IPA) and pathway of glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism were significantly altered after acute PQ intoxication; 2-hydroxybutyric acid and the ratio of L-serine/glycine were of significance between acute and chronic PQ intoxication. Then targeted metabolomics profiling was conducted by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis to confirm the changes of IPA after acute PQ intoxication. Moreover, IPA-producing gut bacteria in feces were quantified by qRT-PCR to explain the varied IPA serum concentration. Clostridium botulinum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were significantly suppressed after acute PQ intoxication. The data suggested that PQ caused oxidative damage partially through suppression of anti-oxidative metabolite producing gut bacteria. In conclusion, we identified characteristic metabolites and pathway of acute and chronic PQ intoxication which could be potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

In Vivo Targeted Metabolomic Profiling of Prostanit, a Novel Anti-PAD NO-Donating Alprostadil-Based Drug	MOLECULES			English	Article						peripheral arterial disease; Prostanit pharmacokinetics; 1; 3-dinitroglycerol; nitric oxide generation; Prostanit metabolomic response	NITRIC-OXIDE; TESTOSTERONE LEVELS; PROSTAGLANDIN E(1); ARTERIAL-DISEASE; EFFICACY; SUPPLEMENTATION; PHARMACOLOGY; ENDOTHELIUM; CHOLESTEROL; IMMUNE	Prostanit is a novel drug developed for the treatment of peripheral arterial diseases. It consists of a prostaglandin E-1 (PGE(1)) moiety with two nitric oxide (NO) donor fragments, which provide a combined vasodilation effect on smooth muscles and vascular spastic reaction. Prostanit pharmacokinetics, however, remains poorly investigated. Thus, the object of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of Prostanit-related and -affected metabolites in rabbit plasma using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) approach. Besides, NO generation from Prostanit in isolated rat aorta and human smooth muscle cells was studied using the Griess method. In plasma, Prostanit was rapidly metabolized to 1,3-dinitroglycerol (1,3-DNG), PGE(1), and 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE(1). Simultaneously, the constant growth of amino acid (proline, 4-hydroxyproline, alanine, phenylalanine, etc.), steroid (androsterone and corticosterone), and purine (adenosine, adenosine-5 monophosphate, and guanosine) levels was observed. Glycine, aspartate, cortisol, and testosterone levels were decreased. Ex vivo Prostanit induced both NO synthase-dependent and -independent NO generation. The observed pharmacokinetic properties suggested some novel beneficial activities (i.e., effect prolongation and anti-inflammation). These properties may provide a basis for future research of the effectiveness and safety of Prostanit, as well as for its characterization from a clinical perspective.

Early-Life Iron Deficiency and Its Natural Resolution Are Associated with Altered Serum Metabolomic Profiles in Infant Rhesus Monkeys	JOURNAL OF NUTRITION			English	Article						infant; iron; iron deficiency; altered liver function; metabolomics; rhesus	FETAL IRON; ANEMIA; LIVER; BRAIN; EVOLUTIONARY; CHOLESTEROL; PERFORMANCE; EXPRESSION; TISSUE; LIPIDS	Background: Iron deficiency is the most common nutrient deficiency in human infants aged 6 to 24 mo, and negatively affects many cellular metabolic processes, including energy production, electron transport, and oxidative degradation of toxins. There can be persistent influences on long-term metabolic health beyond its acute effects. Objectives: The objective was to determine how iron deficiency in infancy alters the serum metabolomic profile and to test whether these effects persist after the resolution of iron deficiency in a nonhuman primate model of spontaneous iron deficiency. Methods: Blood was collected from naturally iron-sufficient (IS; n = 10) and iron-deficient (ID; n = 10) male and female infant rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) at 6 mo of age. Iron deficiency resolved without intervention upon feeding of solid foods, and iron status was re-evaluated at 12 mo of age from the IS and formerly ID monkeys using hematological and other indices; sera were metabolically profiled using HPLC/MS and GC/MS with isobaric standards for identification and quantification at both time points. Results: A total of 413 metabolites were measured, with differences in 40 metabolites identified between IS and ID monkeys at 6 mo (P = 0.05). At 12 mo, iron-related hematological parameters had returned to normal, but the formerly ID infants remained metabolically distinct from the age-matched IS infants, with 48 metabolites differentially expressed between the groups. Metabolomic profiling indicated altered liver metabolites, differential fatty acid production, increased serum uridine release, and atypical bile acid production in the ID monkeys. Conclusions: Pathway analyses of serum metabolites provided evidence of a hypometabolic state, altered liver function, differential essential fatty acid production, irregular uracil metabolism, and atypical bile acid production in ID infants. Many metabolites remained altered after the resolution of ID, suggesting long-term effects on metabolic health.

This novel sampling approach was successful in acquiring a broad metabolic fingerprint, capturing unique metabolites and detecting changes in metabolic profiles associated with fruit maturation. Several metabolites and chemical classes, including volatile esters, phenylpropanoid metabolites, 1-octen-3-ol, hexanal, and (2E,4E)-2,4-hexadienal were found to be up-regulated in response to fruit maturation. For the first time, Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, metabolites with important biological activities, including anti-cancer, anti-viral, anti-parasitic, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity, were detected in apples. Considering the elimination of oxidative degradation mechanisms that adversely impact the representativeness of metabolome obtained ex vivo, and further evidence that lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway contributes to volatile production in intact fruit, in vivo DI-SPME represents an attractive approach for global plant metabolite studies.

Orally administered phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE 5) inhibitors are the most used pharmaceutical formulations for the treatment of ED. In this study, it is aimed to investigate the metabolomics feature of orally administered vardenafil in rats. To carry out the experimental procedure eight male Wistar albino rats were used. Their livers were gently removed and metabolomics profiles of each sample were determined by UPLC Q-TOF MS. Identification of metabolites was achieved by the METLIN database. Cluster analysis was also performed via Principle Component Analysis. Several metabolites were identified and results were evaluated by XCMS software. UPLC Q-TOF MS could be successfully applied to profile biomarkers and help us understand the molecular mechanisms of vardenafil usage. It was concluded that the level of some metabolites, responsible for the collagen synthesis and Kreb's cycle, has been statistically significant after the vardenafil administration.

The genes for As-III oxidation (aio) encode a periplasmic As-III sensor AioX, transmembrane histidine kinase AioS, and cognate regulatory partner AioR, which control expression of the As-III oxidase AioBA. The aio genes are under ultimate control of the phosphate stress response via histidine kinase PhoR. To better understand the cell-wide impacts exerted by these key histidine kinases, we employed H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) and liquid chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics to characterize the metabolic profiles of Delta phoR and Delta aioS mutants of Agrobacterium tumefaciens 5A during As-III oxidation. The data reveals a smaller group of metabolites impacted by the Delta aioS mutation, including hypoxanthine and various maltose derivatives, while a larger impact is observed for the Delta phoR mutation, influencing betaine, glutamate, and different sugars. The metabolomics data were integrated with previously published transcriptomics analyses to detail pathways perturbed during As-III oxidation and those modulated by PhoR and/or AioS. The results highlight considerable disruptions in central carbon metabolism in the Delta phoR mutant. These data provide a detailed map of the metabolic impacts of As-III, PhoR, and/or AioS, and inform current paradigms concerning arsenic-microbe interactions and nutrient cycling in contaminated environments.

To date, no report has documented the consequence of salt stress on metabolite accumulation in purslane. Herein, we proposed an insight into the metabolic and physiological traits of purslane under saline stress environments. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was used to scrutinize the metabolic profiling of leaves and roots of two purslane genotypes, Tall Green (TG) and Shandong Wild (SD), under the control and saline exposures. Results revealed that the morphological and physiological traits of leaves and roots of both the testedPortulaca oleraceacultivars in response to salt stress (100 mM and 200 mM) were dramatically changed. Similarly, significant differences were found in the metabolite profiles among samples under salinity stress treatments as compared with the control. Thorough metabolic pathway analysis, 132 different metabolites in response to 28 days of particular salt stress treatments were recognized and quantified in roots and leaves of purslane, including 35 organic acids, 26 amino acids, 20 sugars, 14 sugar alcohols, 20 amines, 13 lipids and sterols, and 4 other acids. In conclusion, this study can be useful for future molecular experiments as a reference to select gene expression levels for the functional characterization of purslane.

Reliable analytical methods able to identify and discriminate products are needed to protect the craft brew market against fraud and counterfeit. Here, H-1 NMR analysis of 31 beer samples, differing for beer style and brewing method (craft or industrial) was combined with multivariate statistical analysis, following both an untargeted and a targeted approach. NMR-based analysis of beer samples was sped developing a specific protocol enabling the automatic identification and quantification of metabolites in approximately thirty seconds per spectrum. A clear discrimination was achieved by exploiting H-1 NMR analysis and multivariate chemometric methods and the targeted approach identified the metabolites responsible for the segregation. Overall, this study reports an analytical approach addressing beer traceability and is the starting point for the development of a standardized protocol for the discrimination of industrial and craft beers.

The metabolomics software platform, XCMS Online, was used to incorporate peak detection, peak grouping, spectra extraction and non-linear retention time correction/alignment. In total, 49 phenolics previously known to promote health benefits were putatively identified in the black walnut kernels. The relative abundance of these phenolics differed significantly among the studied cultivars. Antioxidant activity of the Mystry extract was highest among the six examined cultivars. In addition, the antioxidant activities were found to be positively correlated with the relative abundance of thirteen phenolics. The principal component analysis provided a visible differentiation in phenolic metabolite profiles among the examined black walnuts. The results of hierarchical cluster analysis showed three clusters of black walnuts. Mystry differed from the other cultivars due to its highest relative abundance of gallic acid and ellagitannins. This study demonstrated that metabolite profiling could be an efficient analytical tool to identify potential health-promoting compounds and investigate metabolite variations among black walnuts.

In the present project, we undertake the challenge to address the need for a new analytical solution for graft quality assessments by using a novel metabolomic diagnostic protocol based on low-invasive solid-phase microextraction. Solid-phase microextraction probes of ca. 0.2 mm coated with 4 mm long mixed-mode extraction phase were inserted into rabbit kidneys immediately following euthanasia and after 2, 4, 6, and 21 h of preservation. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the extracts was performed with the use of a reversed phase column and a Q-Exactive Focus mass spectrometer operated in positive ionization mode. Statistical analysis of significantly changing compounds revealed metabolic profile changes in kidneys induced by ischemia and oxidative stress as a function of the duration of cold storage. The most pronounced alterations were reflected in levels of essential amino acids and purine nucleosides. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed approach may be successfully used to monitor changes in the metabolic profile of organs over time of preservation.

The excellent bioactivity of SMU-B highlights the importance of determining its metabolic traits, which could provide meaningful information for further pharmacokinetic studies of SMU-B. In this work, we studied the metabolism of SMU-B in human liver microsomes. Three metabolites of SMU-B were identified by a quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometer (Q-TOF-MS), and the metabolic pathways of SMU-B were demethylation, dehydrogenation and oxidation. CYP3A4/5 was the principal isoform involved in SMU-B metabolism, as shown by chemical inhibition and recombination human enzyme studies. Additionally, a predication with a molecular docking model confirmed that SMU-B could interact with the active sites of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. This study illuminates the metabolic profile of the anti-tumor drug SMU-B, which will accelerate its clinical use. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

BRACTEATUM EXTRACT; OXIDATIVE STRESS; MEMORY DEFICITS; MOUSE MODEL; GASTRODIN; PARISHIN; BRAIN; PHARMACOKINETICS; IMPAIRMENT; TOXICITY	Militarine, a natural glucosyloxybenzyl 2-isobutylmalate, isolated from Bletilla striata, was reported with a prominent neuroprotective effect recently. The limited information on the metabolism of militarine impedes comprehension of its biological actions and pharmacology. This study aimed to investigate the metabolite profile and the distribution of militarine in vivo, which help to clarify the action mechanism further. A total of 71 metabolites (57 new metabolites) in rats were identified with a systematic method by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography combined with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS). The proposed metabolic pathways of militarine include hydrolyzation, oxidation, glycosylation, esterification, sulfation, glucuronidation and glycine conjugation. Militarine and its metabolites were distributed extensively in the treated rats. Notably, six metabolites of militarine were identified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which were highly consistent with the metabolites after oral administration of gastrodin in rats. Among the metabolites in CSF, five of them were not reported before. It is the first systematic metabolic study of militarine in vivo, which is very helpful for better comprehension of the functions and the central nervous system (CNS) bioactivities of militarine. The findings will also provide an essential reference for the metabolism of other glucosylated benzyl esters of succinic, malic, tartaric and citric acids.

By the unrivaled mass resolution, it was possible to uncover and assign compositional information to thousands of yet unknown metabolites in the beer matrix. The application of several statistical models enabled the assignment of different molecular pattern to certain beer attributes such as the beer type, the way of adding hops and the grain used. The dedicated van Krevelen diagrams and mass difference networks displayed the structural connectivity of the annotated sum formulae. Thereby it was possible to provide a base of knowledge of the beer metabolome far above database-dependent annotations. Typical metabolic signatures for beer types, which reflect differences in ingredients and ways of brewing, could be extracted. Besides, the complexity of isomeric compounds, initially profiled as single mass values in fast FIA-FTICR-MS, was resolved by selective UHPLC-ToF-MS2 analysis. Thereby structural hypotheses based on FTICR's sum formulae could be confirmed. Benzoxazinoid hexosides deriving from the wheat's secondary metabolism were uncovered as suitable marker substances for the use of whole wheat grains, in contrast to merely wheat starch or barley. Furthermore, it was possible to describe Hydroxymethoxybenzoxazinone(HMBOA)-hexosesulfate as a hitherto unknown phytoanticipin derivative in wheat containing beers. These findings raise the potential of ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry for rapid quality control and inspection purposes as well as deep metabolic profiling, profound search for distinct hidden metabolites and classification of archeological beer samples.

The current study focused on the metabolomic profiling of patients from whom glioma specimens were obtained for the identification of specific metabolites that could distinguish the low grade and high grade. In the current study, H-1 NMR spectroscopy was carried out and the data were analyzed by partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal projection to latent structure with discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). Pathway analysis was done to associate characteristic metabolites with the grades of sample using MetaboAnalyst 4.0 software based on the KEGG metabolic pathways database. Distinctive metabolic profiles among low- and high-grade gliomas with top 15 characteristic metabolites that could discriminate these grades were identified on the basis of their VIP scores from the OPLS-DA model. The major altered metabolic pathways include choline, taurine and hypotaurine, glutamate/glutamine, glutathione, and phenyl alanine/tyrosine, which were found to be consistent with the particular grade of a sample. Our study clearly demonstrated a characteristic metabolic profile of individual grades of glioma, suggesting that an altered metabolism is consistent with the specific grades of glioma appreciation and could lead to the development novel treatment strategies.

In this study, we employed gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, direct infusion-mass spectrometry, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify useful metabolites, lipids, and carotenoids in vegetable juice (VJ) fermented with Lactobacillus plantarum HY7712, Lactobacillus plantarum HY7715, Lactobacillus helveticus HY7801, and Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis HY8002. A total of 41 metabolites, 24 lipids, and 4 carotenoids were detected in the fermented and non-fermented VJ (control). The lycopene, alpha-carotene, and beta-carotene levels were higher in VJ fermented with L. plantarum strains (HY7712 and HY7715) than in the control. Proline content was also elevated in VJ fermented with HY7715. Uracil, succinic acid, and alpha-carotene concentration was increased in VJ fermented with HY7801, while glycine and lycopene levels were raised in VJ fermented with HY8002. This study confirmed that each probiotic strain has distinctive characteristics and produces unique changes to metabolic profiles of VJ during fermentation. Our results suggest that probiotic-fermented VJ is a promising functional beverage that contains more beneficial metabolites and carotenoids than commercial non-fermented VJ.

It has been reported that OA can cause liver toxicity after higher doses or longer-term use. Therefore, the study aims to explore the possible hepatotoxicity mechanism based on liver metabolic profiles. Liver metabolic profiles were obtained from untargeted ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS) technique. It was found that altered bile acid, amino acid, and energy metabolism might be at least partly responsible for OA-induced hepatotoxicity. Bile acid metabolism, as the most important pathway, was verified by using UHPLC-TSQ-MS, indicating that conjugated bile acids were the main contributors to OA-induced liver toxicity. Our findings confirmed that increased bile acids were the key element of OA hepatotoxicity, which may open new insights for OA hepatotoxicity in-depth investigations, as well as provide a reference basis for more hepatotoxic drug mechanism research.

This necessitates the need to discover novel anti-HCV drugs to overcome emerging drug resistance and liver complications. Purpose: Total extract and petroleum ether fraction of the marine sponge (Amphimedon spp.) were used for silver nanoparticle (SNP) synthesis to explore their HCV NS3 helicase- and protease-inhibitory potential. Methods: Characterization of the prepared SNPs was carried out with ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The metabolomic profile of different Amphimedon fractions was assessed using liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Fourteen known compounds were isolated and their HCV helicase and protease activities assessed using in silico modeling of their interaction with both HCV protease and helicase enzymes to reveal their anti-HCV mechanism of action. In vitro anti-HCV activity against HCV NS3 helicase and protease was then conducted to validate the computation results and compared to that of the SNPs. Results: Transmission electron-microscopy analysis of NPs prepared from Amphimedon total extract and petroleum ether revealed particle sizes of 8.22-14.30 nm and 8.22-9.97 nm, and absorption bands at lambda(max) of 450 and 415 nm, respectively. Metabolomic profiling revealed the richness of Amphimedon spp. with different phytochemical classes. Bioassay-guided isolation resulted in the isolation of 14 known compounds with anti-HCV activity, initially revealed by docking studies. In vitro anti-HCV NS3 helicase and protease assays of both isolated compounds and NPs further confirmed the computational results. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that Amphimedon, total extract, petroleum ether fraction, and derived NPs are promising biosources for providing anti-HCV drug candidates, with nakinadine B and 3,4-dihydro-6-hydroxymanzamine A the most potent anti-HCV agents, possessing good oral bioavailability and penetration power.

Although C. mangga is commonly used, information on the relationship between its chemical constituents and the bioactivities of the rhizomes is still limited. The extraction solvents used have a strong effect on the metabolite profile and the bioactivity of the extract. A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics approach was used to differentiate the metabolite profiles of hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol fractions of C. mangga rhizomes and to correlate the metabolites with alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity. Primary and secondary metabolites were identified, including curcuminoids, carbohydrates, terpenoids, and amino acids. The ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) analysis of the most active fraction (ethyl acetate) revealed the identification of additional metabolites, such as zerumin A, epigallocatechin, p-hydroxycinnamic, and copallic acids. A partial least square (PLS) biplot demonstrated that the existence of curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, curcumanggoside, calcaratarin A, labda-8(17),12-diene-15,16-dial, zerumin B, and difurocumenonol in the ethyl acetate fraction could be responsible for the alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity.

It is used as herbal remedy and health food in Asian countries, together with its cultured mycelia used as a substitute of natural O. sinensis. In the present study, natural O. sinensis collected from three geographical regions and its cultured mycelia derived from three strains were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) combined with chemometrics. A total of 72 metabolites were identified from all samples with different metabolic profiles observed between natural O. sinensis and cultured mycelia. Among them, 50 metabolites showed significant differences between natural O. sinensis and cultured mycelia. Higher levels of trehalose, glycerol and citric acid in natural O. sinensis were found compared to those in cultured mycelia, while myo-inositol and some amino acids were more abundant in cultured mycelia. In addition, chemical compositions of natural O. sinensis varied depending on the geographical regions. Natural O. sinensis from three locations were clearly differentiated by the concentrations of meso-erythritol, D-mannitol, glucose and organic acids. The current study provides a comprehensive metabolic profiles of natural O. sinensis and its cultured mycelia, which is potentially important for understanding the metabolism of O. sinensis and facilitating the application of cultured mycelia as a supplement of natural O. sinensis.

These properties are likely due to the sophisticated metabolic networks during fermentation, which are mainly driven by microbiota. However, the exact roles of metabolic pathways and the microbial community during this process remain equivocal. RESULTS Here, we investigated the microbial dynamics by next-generation sequencing, and outlined a differential non-targeted metabolite profiling in the process of serofluid dish fermentation using the method of hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography column with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry.Lactobacilluswas the leading genus of bacteria, whilePichiaandIssatchenkiawere the dominant fungi. They all accumulated during fermentation. In total, 218 differential metabolites were identified, of which organic acids, amino acids, sugar and sugar alcohols, fatty acids, and esters comprised the majority. The constructed metabolic network showed that tricarboxylic acid cycle, urea cycle, sugar metabolism, amino acids metabolism, choline metabolism, and flavonoid metabolism were regulated by the fermentation. Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed that the leading fungi,PichiaandIssatchenkia, were linked to organic acids, amino acid and sugar metabolism, flavonoids, and several other flavor and functional components. Antibacterial tests indicated the antibacterial effect of serofluid soup againstSalmonellaandStaphylococcus. CONCLUSION This work provides new insights into the complex microbial and metabolic networks during serofluid dish fermentation, and a theoretical basis for the optimization of its industrial production.

This study aimed to apply a reliable and simple method to identify important biological metabolites relevant to PZQ in crucian carp (Carassius auratus) to decipher the metabolic pathways and provide a basis for developing new anti-parasite drugs. The experimental group of crucian carp was administered oral PZQ at a dose of 10 mg kg(-1) via a stomach feed tube. All biological blood samples were analysed using liquid chromatography electrospray ionization/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC ESI/Q-TOF MS). MetPA analysis was used to identify relevant pathways for PZQ in crucian carp. Thirty-five potential metabolic pathways were revealed by MetPA network software. Furthermore, the chemical structures of the related metabolites and pathways were identified by comparison with data obtained from free online databases.

Current clinical diagnosis methods require tedious work to distinguish MPE from benign pleural effusion (BPE). The objective of this study was to characterize the metabolic signatures in MPE of lung cancer, and identify potential metabolite biomarkers for diagnosis of MPE. MPE from lung cancer (n=46) and BPE from tuberculosis patients (n=32) were investigated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based global metabolomic and lipidomic profiling. Multivariate partial least square discriminative analysis models exhibited distinct metabolic profiles between MPE and BPE. A total of 25 ether lipids, including phosphatidylcholines (PC), lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC) and phosphatidylethanolamines (PE), were observed to be significantly downregulated in MPE with excellent diagnostic potential. Plasmalogen PC(40:3p) showed highest AUC value of 0.953 in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) model. Oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were upregulated in MPE. The obtained results implied a high oxidative stress and peroxisome disorder in lung cancer patients. Combined metabolomic and lipidomic profiling have discovered potential biomarkers in MPE with excellent clinical diagnostic capability. Dysregulated ether lipids and oxidized PUFAs have implied an aberrant redox metabolism, which provides novel insights into the pathology of MPE in lung cancer. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The contamination is even more intense due to climate changes and different stressors. This study examined the impact of fullerol C-60(OH)(24) nanoparticles (FNP) (at 0, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 ng mL(-1)) on the secondary metabolite profile of the most relevant foodborne mycotoxigenic fungi from genera Aspergillus, Fusarium, Alternaria and Penicillium, during growth in vitro. Fungi were grown in liquid RPMI 1640 media for 72 h at 29 degrees C, and metabolites were investigated by the LC-MS/MS dilute and shoot multimycotoxin method. Exposure to FNP showed great potential in decreasing the concentrations of 35 secondary metabolites; the decreases were dependent on FNP concentration and fungal genus. These results are a relevant guide for future examination of fungi-FNP interactions in environmental conditions. The aim is to establish the exact mechanism of FNP action and determine the impact such interactions have on food and feed safety.

The metabolite profiling of the extracts could identify the bioactive compounds based on methanol (MET), ethanol (ETH), chloroform (CHL), hexane (HEX) and water (W) solvent systems. The microalgal crude extracts in co-application with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) had enhanced antimicrobial activity with potential to overcome the global problem of microbial antibiotic resistance. Results: Chlorella sp. exhibited the highest lipid, N. oculata the highest total saturated fatty acids (TSFA), and T. suecica the highest mono-unsaturated (MUFA) and poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The highest carbohydrate, protein and total phenolics contents (TPCs) were attained by N. oculata. The highest total flavonoids contents (TFCs), and chlorophyll a and b were in T. suecica, while comparable level of carotenoids were found in all species. For high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) analyses, the eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) with high peaks were detected in T. suecica-HEX and N. oculata-CHL; and beta-carotene in Chlorella sp.-ETH. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses showed high 13-docosenamide (Z)- in T. suecica-HEX; phytol in N. oculata-HEX; and neophytadiene in Chlorella sp.-ETH. The AgNPs-MCEs-MET and HEX at the 1.5:1 ratios exhibited strong activities against Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus uberis, and Salmonella sp.; and the AgNPs-T. suecica-HEX and MET and AgNPs-Chlorella sp.-HEX at the 1.5:1 ratios exhibited activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae. Conclusion: Different bioactive components were detected in the MCEs based on the HPTLC and GC-MS analyses. Significant antimicrobial activities against the pathogenic microbes were demonstrated by the synergistic effects of the MCEs in co-application with the AgNPs. This could be beneficial in the fight against sensitive and multidrug-resistant bacteria.

None of the tested samples affected the viability of HaCaT cells in a concentration range of 25-150 mu g/mL. VNE and VNF4 exhibited significant cytotoxic effects in A431 cells, with IC50 values of 81.92 and 12.27 mu g/mL, respectively; the selectivity index was higher than 10 for VNF4. The untargeted LC/HR-MS/MS metabolite profiling led to the tentative annotation of a total number of 23 compounds. Of these, VNE comprised mainly iridoid glycosides (harpagoside, laterioside, acylated aucubin derivatives), whereas VNF4 showed a high abundance of triterpene saponin glycosides (ilwensisaponins A and C, songarosaponins A and B), constituents known for their selective cytotoxic potential.

Comfrey anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties have been proven in clinical studies. However, the bioactive compounds associated with these therapeutic activities are yet to be identified. An LC-ESI-Orbitrap-MS(n)metabolite profile of a hydroalcoholic extract of comfrey root guided the identification of 20 compounds, including a new arylnaphthalene lignan bearing a rare delta-lactone ring, named comfreyn A. Its structure was determined using extensive 2D NMR and ESI-MS experiments. Additionally, the occurrence of malaxinic acid, caffeic acid ethyl ester, along with the lignans ternifoliuslignan D, 3-carboxy-6,7-dihydroxy-1-(3 ',4 '-dihydroxyphenyl) -naphthalene, globoidnan A and B, and rabdosiin was reported inS. officinalefor the first time. These results helped to redefine the metabolite profile of this medicinal plant. Finally, caffeic acid ethyl ester and comfreyn A were found to significantly inhibit E-selectin expression in IL-1 beta stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), with EC values of 64 and 50 mu M, respectively.

Herein, metabolites, such as free sugars, and organic acids and antioxidant activity were determined in 10 new and 14 traditional apple cultivars. Additionally, the phenolic profiles of the apple pulp and peel were characterized by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Major phenolic compounds in apples varied depending on the cultivar and tissue (i.e., peel or pulp). Among the new apple cultivars, Decobell and Tinkerbell, showed high antioxidant activity and contained higher phenolic compound content than other cultivars in the peel and pulp, respectively. Honggeum showed high phenolic content with similar sugar to acid ratio compared to popular traditional cultivars. In addition to antioxidant phenolic contents, metabolite profile information can be used to select apple cultivars for various purposes. For example, Indo can be selected for sweet apple taste because of its higher sugar to acid ratio. This information can be used to select apple cultivars for various purposes. For example, Decobell peel could be used as sources of food supplements and food additives, and Tinkerbell pulp can be utilized for apple juice making according to its metabolite profile.

To date, there is no well-established mouse model with a comprehensive metabolic profile that mimics ALD in humans. This study aimed to explore the differential metabolic pathways and related differential metabolites in the liver of an ALD mouse model. Material/Methods: A C57BU6J mouse model of ALD was induced by alcohol feeding for 10 days plus binge alcohol feeding. The metabolomic profiles in the liver of the ALD mouse model was detected through ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS). Results: A total 35 metabolites were significantly altered during the development of ALD. These metabolites were cor-related to multiple metabolic pathways, including purine metabolism, the pentose phosphate pathway, cysteine and methionine metabolism, D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, and vitamin B6 metabolism. Conclusions: The findings of the present study reveal potential biomarkers of ALD, and provide further insights into the pathogenesis of ALD.

Methods: The study population consisted of 38 metalworkers. All participants underwent a standardized medical examination. Blood samples were collected before and after work shift and analyzed with gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Multivariate modeling (orthogonal partial least-squares analysis with discriminant analysis [OPLS-DA]) were used to verify differences in metabolic profiles. Results: Twenty-two study participants reported vascular symptoms judged as vibration-related. The metabolic profile from participants with vibration-induced white fingers (VWF) was distinctly separated from participants without VWF, both before and after vibration exposure. Conclusion: Metabolites that differed between the groups were identified both before and after exposure. Some of these metabolites might be indicators of health effects from exposure to vibrations. This is the first time that a metabolomic approach has been used in workers exposed to vibrations.

This study thus aimed to reveal the role of induced sputum metabolomics in predicting COPD severity. In this pilot study, a total of 20 COPD patients were included. The induced sputum metabolites were assayed using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system. Five oxidative stress products (myeloperoxidase (MPO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), neutrophil elastase (NE), and 8-iso-PGF2 alpha) in induced sputum were measured by ELISA, and the metabolomic profiles were distinguished by principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) was used for pathway enrichment analysis, and a significant difference in induced sputum metabolomics was observed between moderate and severe COPD. The KEGG analysis revealed that the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway was downregulated in severe COPD. Due to the critical role of glycerophospholipid metabolism in oxidative stress, significant negative correlations were discovered between glycerophospholipid metabolites and three oxidative stress products (SOD, MPO, and 8-iso-PGF2 alpha). The diagnostic values of SOD, MPO, and 8-iso-PGF2 alpha in induced sputum were found to exhibit high sensitivities and specificities in the prediction of COPD severity. Collectively, this study provides the first identification of the association between induced sputum metabolomic profiles and COPD severity, indicating the potential value of metabolomics in PPPM for COPD management. The study also reveals the correlation between glycerophospholipid metabolites and oxidative stress products and their value for predicting COPD severity.

Identification of the metabolomic profile associated with vitamin D helps to identify novel biomarkers and increase the understanding of the biochemical and physiological role of vitamin Din different health conditions. Method: Serum metabolomic profiling was performed using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry [LC/MS] and their association with serum 25(OH)D was evaluated using multivariable linear regression in the baseline cohort of 316 participants (aged 20 or above; 92 men, 224 women; mean age +/- SD: 48.1 +/- 15.8 years) and in the follow-up cohort of 275 participants (aged 20 or above; 12 men, 263 women; mean age: 56.2 +/- 9.6) of the Hong Kong Osteoporosis Study. We discovered and validated potential metabolites; and by meta-analysis of these associations in two cohorts, we identified metabolites that were significantly associated with serum 25(OH)D levels. Results: Among 835 known metabolites, 102 metabolites showed significant correlation with 25(OH)D levels at baseline visit. Of these metabolites, 27 were validated in the follow-up visit. In meta-analysis of data from these two visits, 13 metabolites were highly correlated with 25(OH)D. The majority of metabolites identified were lipid in nature. Docosahexaenoylcarnitine and eicosapentaenoylcholine had the highest correlations, with effect estimates 0.2554 (p = 9.60 x 10(-9)) and 0.1682 (p = 4.94 x 10(-7)) respectively. Conclusion: In Hong Kong Chinese at least, serum vitamin D level is closely related to lipid metabolism. Our finding highlights an important new direction in the study of vitamin D in different health conditions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

We aimed to investigate the urine metabolome and its association with cardiovascular risk to identify novel markers that might complement current estimators based on age. Urine samples were collected from 234 subjects categorized into three age-grouped cohorts: 30-50 years (cohort I, young), 50-70 years (cohort II, middle-aged), and > 70 years (cohort III, elderly). Each cohort was further classified into three groups: (a) control, (b) individuals with cardiovascular risk factors, and (c) those who had a previous cardiovascular event. Novel urinary metabolites linked to cardiovascular risk were identified by nuclear magnetic resonance in cohort I and then evaluated by target mass spectrometry quantification in all cohorts. A previously identified metabolic fingerprint associated with atherosclerosis was also analyzed and its potential risk estimation investigated in the three aged cohorts. Three different metabolic signatures were identified according to age: 2-hydroxybutyrate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, hypoxanthine, guanidoacetate, oxaloacetate, and serine in young adults; citrate, cyclohexanol, glutamine, lysine, pantothenate, pipecolate, threonine, and tyramine shared by middle-aged and elderly adults; and trimethylamine N-oxide and glucuronate associated with cardiovascular risk in all three cohorts. The urinary metabolome contains a metabolic signature of cardiovascular risk that differs across age groups. These signatures might serve to complement existing algorithms and improve the accuracy of cardiovascular risk prediction for personalized prevention. Key messages center dot Cardiovascular risk in the young and elderly is underestimated. center dot The urinary metabolome reflects cardiovascular risk across all age groups. center dot Six metabolites constitute a metabolic signature of cardiovascular risk in young adults. center dot Middle-aged and elderly adults share a cardiovascular risk metabolic signature. center dot TMAO and glucuronate levels reflect cardiovascular risk across all age groups.

Most current methods in single-cell analysis rely on cell manipulation, potentially altering the abundance of metabolites in individual cells. A small sample volume and the chemical diversity of metabolites are additional challenges in single-cell metabolomics. Here, we describe the combination of fiber-based laser ablation electrospray ionization (f-LAESI) with 21 T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (21TFTICR-MS) for in situ single-cell metabolic profiling in plant tissue. Single plant cells infected by bacteria were selected and sampled directly from the tissue without cell manipulation through mid-infrared ablation with a fine optical fiber tip for ionization by f-LAESI. Ultrahigh performance 21T-FTICR-MS enabled the simultaneous capture of isotopic fine structures (IFSs) for 47 known and 11 unknown compounds, thus elucidating their elemental compositions from single cells and providing information on metabolic heterogeneity in the cell population.

AGRONOMY-BASEL			English	Article						leafy vegetables; cut-and-come-again; yield; nitrogen; antioxidants; metabolomics; secondary metabolites	LEAF-AREA; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY; USE EFFICIENCY; NITROGEN; GROWTH; DEFOLIATION; TRAITS; PLANTS; CULTIVATION	Sweet basil (Ocimum basilicumL.) is an aromatic, tender leafy green cultivated for the fresh market and industrial processing. Like many other leafy vegetables, this species can be harvested more than once to increase productivity. Although the cut-and-come-again (CC) harvest strategy is widespread in basil, not much is known about the effect of the cut. In this work, we examined differences in biomass, physiology, nutrient use efficiency and antioxidant capacity of basil leaves from two successive harvests. Moreover, we also performed an untargeted metabolomics analysis to reveal variations in the leaf metabolite profile. The data indicated that the cut affected many of the parameters under investigation, including a modest reduction of yield (-20%), of nitrogen use efficiency (-21%) and of some quality attributes such as the antioxidant capacity (-16%) and the nitrate content in leaves (+48%). Moreover, leaves of successive cuts displayed a significant variation of the profile of bioactive compounds, characterized by an overall decrease of phenylpropanoids and an increase in terpenoids. Our data revealed the impact of CC harvesting strategy in basil, and that this strategy offers the possibility to yield leaves with different metabolomics profiles and quality attributes.

In vivo COX-2 modulation and metabolite profiling of Pandanus tectorius leaves extracts	3 BIOTECH			English	Article						Pandanus tectorius; Cyclooxygenase; Inflammation; Immunohistochemistry	CYCLOOXYGENASE-2; PATHWAY; CARRAGEENAN; EXPRESSION; FRUITS; CELLS	The Pandanus tectorius methanolic (PTM) and P. tectorius aqueous (PTA) extracts were investigated for their potential in vivo anti-inflammatory activity using carrageenan-induced rat paw edema. Parameters including paw thickness measurement, histopathological, and immunohistochemical cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression analyses were measured and analyzed. PTA at 500 mg/kg significantly reduced inflammation after induction of carrageenan (Carr), with mean paw thickness change of 0.110 +/- 0.024 mm at sixth hour post-induction and histopathological mean inflammatory grade of 1.80 +/- 0.20. The reduced immunohistochemical COX-2 expression using PTA at 500 mg/kg was determined with mean final 3,3 '-diaminobenzidine (DAB) intensity of 63.70 +/- 2.08. The profiling of metabolites by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) revealed presence of ethyl caffeate and dihydroconiferyl alcohol as putative secondary metabolites of PTA which were the major peaks and have been reported to possess anti-inflammatory activities. This research has provided scientific insights of utilizing P. tectorius as a potential anti-inflammatory agent containing secondary metabolites which may be pharmacologically relevant.

After oral ingestion, constituents inO. horridusextract (OhE) could be converted to their metabolites by the enteric microbiome before absorption. In this study, in order to mimic gut environment, the OhE was biotransformed using the enteric microbiome of healthy human subjects. For accurate and reliable data collection with optimized approaches in sample preparation and analytical conditions, ultra-performance liquid chromatography and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry were used to characterize parent constituents and their metabolites. In the extract, 20 parent compounds were identified including polyynes, sesquiterpenes, monoterpeondids, phenylpropanoids and phenolic acids. After the biotransformation, a total of 78 metabolites were identified, of which 37 belonged to polyynes metabolites. The common biotransformation pathways are hydroxylation, acetylization, methylation and demethylation. Based on the pathway distributions, the metabolism signature of OhE has been explored. The metabolism pathways of OhE compounds are dependent on their structural classifications and hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties. In summary, with comprehensive analysis, we systematically investigated human microbiome-derived OhE metabolites. The enteric microbial metabolism signature provides novel information for future effective use ofO. horridus.

This study presents optimized analytical methods for metabolic profiling in the fruits of three Solanaceae species: Lycium barbarum, Lycium chinense and Solanum lycopersicum. It includes the most important chemical classes involved in nutrition and taste, i.e., carotenoids, phenolic compounds and primary compounds. Emphasis has been placed on the systematic achievement of good extraction yields, sample stability, and high response linearity using common LC-ESI-TQ-MS and GC-EI-MS apparatuses. A set of 13 carotenoids, 46 phenolic compounds and 67 primary compounds were profiled in fruit samples. Chemometrics revealed metabolic markers discriminating Lycium and Solanum fruits but also Lycium barbarum and Lycium chinense fruits and the effect of the crop environment. Typical tomato markers were found to be lycopene, carotene, glutamate and GABA, while lycibarbarphenylpropanoids and zeaxanthin esters characterized goji (Lycium spp.) fruits. Among the compounds discriminating the Lycium species, reported here for the first time to our knowledge, chlorogenic acids, asparagine and quinic acid were more abundant in Lycium chinense, whereas Lycium barbarum accumulated more lycibarbarphenylpropanoids A-B, coumaric acid, fructose and glucose.

However, heterogeneous biological behaviors persist within breast cancer subtypes. Metabolomics is a rapidly-expanding field of study dedicated to cellular metabolisms affected by the environment. The aim of this study was to compare metabolomic signatures of BC obtained by 5 different unsupervised machine learning (ML) methods. Fifty-two consecutive patients with BC with an indication for adjuvant chemotherapy between 2013 and 2016 were retrospectively included. We performed metabolomic profiling of tumor resection samples using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Here, four hundred and forty-nine identified metabolites were selected for further analysis. Clusters obtained using 5 unsupervised ML methods (PCA k-means, sparse k-means, spectral clustering, SIMLR and k-sparse) were compared in terms of clinical and biological characteristics. With an optimal partitioning parameter k = 3, the five methods identified three prognosis groups of patients (favorable, intermediate, unfavorable) with different clinical and biological profiles. SIMLR and K-sparse methods were the most effective techniques in terms of clustering. In-silico survival analysis revealed a significant difference for 5-year predicted OS between the 3 clusters. Further pathway analysis using the 449 selected metabolites showed significant differences in amino acid and glucose metabolism between BC histologic subtypes. Our results provide proof-of-concept for the use of unsupervised ML metabolomics enabling stratification and personalized management of BC patients. The design of novel computational methods incorporating ML and bioinformatics techniques should make available tools particularly suited to improving the outcome of cancer treatment and reducing cancer-related mortalities.

However, the exact mechanisms underlying protective effects of probiotic in sepsis has not been elucidated clearly. The aim of this study was to explore the therapeutic effects of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) prophylaxis on the host co-microbiota and metabolism in mice with sepsis-induced colon microbiota dysbiosis. Methods: Mice were fed either probiotic LGG or saline 4 wk before cecum ligation and puncture (CLP) operation. Fecal samples were collected and analyzed by 16S rDNA sequencing and ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOE-MS)-based metabolomics. Results: LGG treatment could noticeably reduce the mortality of sepsis and reverse gut microbiota dysbiosis caused by sepsis. Specifically, LGG reduced conditional pathogenic bacteria, such as Proteobactria and Deferribacteres; lipopolysaccharide producers like Enterobacteriaceae, facultative anaerobes, including Bacteroidaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae, and increased the abundance of bacteria related to energy harvest, such as Firmicutes; colon barrier restorers like Akkermansia; and liver function regulators like Coprococcus and Sutterella. Furthermore, the changes in fecal metabolites were prevented by LGG. These changes were found mainly to be correlated with the bile acid and metabolism pathways, lysophosphatidylcholines metabolism, and eicosatetraenoic acid metabolism. Finally, correlation analysis shown that microbiota dysbiosis was closely related to metabolic imbalance. Conclusions: Probiotic LGG may has a positive effect on reducing mortality of sepsis through rebalancing the metabolic profiles and gut microbiota. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the colonic microbiota and the colonic and systemic metabolome of female pigs differing in health status induced by sanitary conditions. We analyzed blood and colon digesta metabolite profiles using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR) and Triple quadrupole mass spectrometry, as well as colonic microbiota profiles. 1H NMR is a quantitative metabolomics technique applicable to biological samples. Weaned piglets of 4 weeks of age were kept under high or low sanitary conditions for the first 9 weeks of life. The microbiota diversity in colon digesta was higher in pigs subjected to low sanitary conditions (n = 18 per treatment group). The abundance of 34 bacterial genera was higher in colon digesta of low sanitary condition pigs, while colon digesta of high sanitary status pigs showed a higher abundance for four bacterial groups including the Megasphaera genus (p < 0.003) involved in lactate fermentation. Metabolite profiles (n = 18 per treatment group) in blood were different between both groups of pigs. These different profiles suggested changes in general nutrient metabolism, and more specifically in amino acid metabolism. Moreover, differences in compounds related to the immune system and responses to stress were observed. Microbiome-specific metabolites in blood were also affected by sanitary status of the pigs. We conclude that the microbiome composition in colon and the systemic metabolite profiles are affected by sanitary conditions and related to suboptimal health. These data are useful for exploring further relationships between health, metabolic status and performance and for the identification of biomarkers related to health (indices) and performance.

A disproportional accumulation of fat at visceral (VAT) compared to subcutaneous sites (SAT) has been suspected as a key detrimental event. We used non-targeted metabolomics profiling to reveal metabolic pathways associated with higher VAT or SAT amount among subjects free of metabolic diseases to identify possible contributing metabolic pathways. The study population comprised 491 subjects [mean (standard deviation): age 44.6yrs (13.0), body mass index 25.4kg/m(2) (3.6), 60.1% females] without diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, the metabolic syndrome or impaired renal function. We associated MRI-derived fat amounts with mass spectrometry-derived metabolites in plasma and urine using linear regression models adjusting for major confounders. We tested for sex-specific effects using interactions terms and performed sensitivity analyses for the influence of insulin resistance on the results. VAT and SAT were significantly associated with 155 (101 urine) and 49 (29 urine) metabolites, respectively, of which 45 (27 urine) were common to both. Major metabolic pathways were branched-chain amino acid metabolism (partially independent of insulin resistance), surrogate markers of oxidative stress and gut microbial diversity, and cortisol metabolism. We observed a novel positive association between VAT and plasma levels of the potential pharmacological agent piperine. Sex-specific effects were only a few, e.g. the female-specific association between VAT and O-methylascorbate. In brief, higher VAT was associated with an unfavorable metabolite profile in a sample of healthy, mostly non-obese individuals from the general population and only few sex-specific associations became apparent.

Less is known about youth with HIV and how oral disorders that commonly accompany HIV infection impact salivary metabolite levels.ObjectiveAs part of the Adolescent Master Protocol multi-site cohort study of the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS) network we compared the salivary metabolome of youth with perinatally-acquired HIV (PHIV) and youth HIV-exposed, but uninfected (PHEU) and determined whether metabolites differ in PHIV versus PHEU.MethodsWe used three complementary targeted and discovery-based liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) workflows to characterize salivary metabolite levels in 20 PHIV and 20 PHEU youth with and without moderate periodontitis. We examined main effects associated with PHIV and periodontal disease, and the interaction between them.ResultsWe did not identify differences in salivary metabolite profiles that remained significant under stringent control for both multiple between-group comparisons and multiple metabolites. Levels of cadaverine, a known periodontitis-associated metabolite, were more abundant in individuals with periodontal disease with the difference being more pronounced in PHEU than PHIV. In the discovery-based dataset, we identified a total of 564 endogenous peptides in the metabolite extracts, showing that proteolytic processing and amino acid metabolism are important to consider in the context of HIV infection.ConclusionThe salivary metabolite profiles of PHIV and PHEU youth were overall very similar. Individuals with periodontitis particularly among the PHEU youth had higher levels of cadaverine, suggesting that HIV infection, or its treatment, may influence the metabolism of oral bacteria.

The evolutionary history of the diversification of microalgae can be inferred from the analysis of their genome sequences. However, the link between the DNA sequence and the associated phenotype is notoriously difficult to assess, all the more so for marine phytoplanktonic microalgae for which the lab culture and, thus, biological experimentation is very tedious. Here, we explore the potential of a high-throughput untargeted metabolomic approach to explore the phenotypic-genotypic gap in 12 marine microalgae encompassing 1.2 billion years of evolution. We identified species- and lineage-specific metabolites. We also provide evidence of a very good correlation between the molecular divergence, inferred from the DNA sequences, and the metabolomic divergence, inferred from the complete metabolomic profiles. These results provide novel insights into the potential of chemotaxonomy in marine phytoplankton and support the hypothesis of a metabolomic clock, suggesting that DNA and metabolomic profiles co-evolve.

For the treatments, quinoa seeds were washed, cooked, and/or germinated. Following treated, we used 1H NMR-based metabolomic profiling to explore differences between the ecotypes. Then, for a non-targeted and targeted food fingerprint analysis of samples, we performed multivariable data analyses, including principal component analysis (PCA), orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), and hierarchical cluster analysis. From our study, we were able to discriminate each quinoa ecotype regardless of treatment based on its metabolomic profiling. Additionally, we were able to identify 30 metabolites that were useful to determine the effect of each treatment on nutritional composition. Germination increased the content of most metabolites irrespective of ecotype. In general, ecotype CQE_03 was different from ecotypes CQE_01 and CQE_02. Our phytochemical analysis revealed the effects of washing, cooking, and/or germination, particularly on saponins content.

In most cooked foods, furan has been found to be coexisted with some alkylated derivatives such as 2-methylfuran. 2-methylfuran was found to be potent hepatotoxins. Little toxicological data is available for 2-methylfuran. The objective of this study was to investigate metabolite changes in the liver samples from mice fed with 2-methylfuran by untargeted metabolomic approach. Metabolomic analysis was conducted by using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Twenty-four metabolites were identified as differential metabolites. The important metabolic pathway was linoleic acid metabolism, glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, methane metabolism, ascorbate, and aldarate metabolism, valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, cysteine, and methionine metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism, and pyruvate metabolism. These newly identified pathways provide evidence for investigating toxic mechanism of 2-methylfuran. Practical Application Furan in foods has caused public health concern for its hepatotoxicity and hepatic carcinogenicity in rodents. The metabolomics method was constructed to find more biomarkers to study underlying hepatotoxic mechanisms of 2-methylfuran. It will offer important information for official limits of 2-methylfuran in foods.

JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY			English	Article						color pigmentation; taproot; radish; metabolome	ANTHOCYANINS; IDENTIFICATION	Radish (Raphanus sativus) is an important worldwide vegetable with a wide variety of colors that affect its appearance and nutritional quality. However, the large-scale detection, identification, and quantification of flavonoids in multicolor radish have rarely been studied. To uncover the diversity and accession-specific flavonoids in radish, liquid chromatography electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry was used to analyze the metabolic profiles in the skin and flesh of six colored radish accessions: light-red Manshenhong, dark-red Touxinhong (TXH), purple Zijinling (ZJL), Xinlimei with red flesh (XLMF) and green skin, white Shizhuangbai (SZB), and black radish. In total, 133 flavonoids, including 16 dihydroflavones, 44 flavones, 14 flavonoids, 9 anthocyanins, and 28 flavonols, were characterized. The flavonoid metabolic profiles differed among the different colored radishes. Red and purple radishes contained similar anthocyanin compounds responsible for color pigmentation, including red cyanidin, callistephin, and pelargonin. Purple ZJL was most enriched with cyanidin o-syringic acid and cyanin, whereas callistephin and pelargonin were more abundant in dark-red TXH. Additionally, the black and white radishes shared similar anthocyanin and flavonoid profiles, suggesting that the color of black radishes was not caused by anthocyanin but by other metabolites. The metabolites in colored radishes that differed from SZB were mainly involved in the biosynthesis of plant secondary metabolites, such as flavonoid, flavone, flavonol, isoflavonoid, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. This study provides new insights into the differences in metabolite profiles among radishes with different skin and flesh colors. The results will be useful for aiding the cultivation of valuable new radish varieties.

Identification of modulated metabolites may provide clues concerning pathways implementing responses in plant-pathogen interactions. A time course study of metabolic fingerprinting of onion yellow dwarf virus (OYDV)-infected versus healthy 'Rossa di Tropea' onion bulbs was performed using proton high-resolution magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 HR-MAS NMR) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC), providing an overview of the metabolic state of the bulb in response to OYDV infection during storage. RESULTS Metabolites accumulated/depleted upon infection were identified, belonging to flavonoid, saccharide, amino acid and organic acid classes. A decrease in quercetin glucosides content and antioxidant activity was observed in infected bulbs; some amino acids (Arg, Asn, Phe, Val) accumulated, while others were depleted (Leu); for some metabolites, a bimodal time-course was observed during storage (Glc, Lys).

However, the metabolic profiles of erianin remain unknown. This study was carried out to investigate the metabolic profiles of erianin in rats and humans. Methods: Erianin was orally administered to rats at a single dose of 50 mg/kg. Urine and bile samples were collected. Forin vitrometabolism, erianin was co-incubated with rat or human hepatocytes at 37 degrees C for 2 h. The samples from incubations and rat were analyzed by liquid chromatography combined with electrospray ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry. The data were processed by MetWorks software. The structures of the metabolites were proposed by comparing the mass spectra with that of the parent compound. Results: A total of twenty-four metabolites were detectedin vitroandin vivo, including seven phase I and eighteen phase II metabolites. The phase I metabolic pathways of erianin were hydroxylation, demethylation and dehydrogenation. Erianin undergoes metabolic activation to form reactive metabolites quinoid intermediates, which were further trapped by glutathione (GSH) orN-acetylcysteine. The phase II metabolic pathways were glucuronidation, glutathione andN-acetylcysteine conjugation. Conclusions: The present study provides an overview pertaining to thein vitroandin vivometabolic profiles of erianin, which is indispensable for us to understand the efficacy and safety of erianin, as well as the herbal medicineD. chrysotoxum.

A Tale of Two Biomarkers: Untargeted H-1 NMR Metabolomic Fingerprinting of BHBA and NEFA in Early Lactation Dairy Cows	METABOLITES			English	Article						metabolic profile; ketosis; transition period; livestock; methyl donor; one-carbon metabolism; negative energy balance	NONESTERIFIED FATTY-ACIDS; BETA-HYDROXYBUTYRATE; SUBCLINICAL KETOSIS; TRANSITION PERIOD; DISPLACED ABOMASUM; MILK-PRODUCTION; ENERGY-BALANCE; CATTLE; SPECTROSCOPY; BLOOD	Disorders of energy metabolism, which can result from a failure to adapt to the period of negative energy balance immediately after calving, have significant negative effects on the health, welfare and profitability of dairy cows. The most common biomarkers of energy balance in dairy cows are beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA). While elevated concentrations of these biomarkers are associated with similar negative health and production outcomes, the phenotypic and genetic correlations between them are weak. In this study, we used an untargeted H-1 NMR metabolomics approach to investigate the serum metabolomic fingerprints of BHBA and NEFA. Serum samples were collected from 298 cows in early lactation (calibration dataset N=248, validation N=50). Metabolomic fingerprinting was done by regressing H-1 NMR spectra against BHBA and NEFA concentrations (determined using colorimetric assays) using orthogonal partial least squares regression. Prediction accuracies were high for BHBA models, and moderately high for NEFA models (R-2 of external validation of 0.88 and 0.75, respectively). We identified 16 metabolites that were significantly (variable importance of projection score > 1) correlated with the concentration of one or both biomarkers. These metabolites were primarily intermediates of energy, phospholipid, and/or methyl donor metabolism. Of the significant metabolites identified; (1) two (acetate and creatine) were positively correlated with BHBA but negatively correlated with NEFA, (2) nine had similar associations with both BHBA and NEFA, (3) two were correlated with only BHBA concentration, and (4) three were only correlated with NEFA concentration. Overall, our results suggest that BHBA and NEFA are indicative of similar metabolic states in clinically healthy animals, but that several significant metabolic differences exist that help to explain the weak correlations between them. We also identified several metabolites that may be useful intermediate phenotypes in genomic selection for improved metabolic health.	[Luke, Timothy D.

Thus far, there is no specific biomarker to predict the response to CRT in patients with heart failure. In this study, we assessed the role of the blood metabolomic profile in predicting the response to CRT. Methods A total of 105 dilated cardiomyopathy patients with severe heart failure who received CRT were included in our two-stage study. Baseline blood samples were collected prior to CRT implantation. The response to CRT was defined according to echocardiographic criteria. Metabolomic profiling of serum samples was carried out using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Results Seventeen metabolites showed significant differences in their levels between responders and non-responders, and these metabolites were primarily involved in six pathways, including linoleic acid metabolism, Valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, citrate cycle, tryptophan metabolism, and sphingolipid metabolism. A combination of isoleucine, tryptophan, and linoleic acid was identified as an ideal metabolite panel to distinguish responders from non-responders in the discovery set (n = 51 with an AUC of 0.981), and it was confirmed in the validation set (n = 54 with an AUC of 0.929). Conclusions Mass spectrometry based serum metabolomics approach provided larger coverage of metabolome which can help distinguish CRT responders from non-responders. A combination of isoleucine, tryptophan, and linoleic acid may associate with significant prognostic values for CRT.

The aim of this study was to find the clues for their synergistic actions by comparing the biliary metabolism and excretion profiles after oral administration of CNS and its individual extracts. An ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with hybrid triple quadrupole-linear ion trap mass spectrometer (UPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS) platform was used to identify and quantify the CNS-derived components in bile. The neutral losses, precursor ions, and predictive multiple reaction monitoring (pMRM) scans were firstly used to detect the CNS-derived ingredients in vivo. A total of 43 components, including 38 flavonoids and 5 ginsenosides were tentatively identified according to the previously established chemical and metabolic profiles of NS and SF. Afterwards, the primary circulating and biological components, hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA), ginsenosides Rg(1) (GRg(1)), Re (GRe), and Rd (GRd) were chosen to compare the bile excretion between CNS and its individual extract groups, by using a validated LC-MRM-MS/MS method. The approach was proved to be well satisfied the related requirements from the guidelines of FDA (specificity, calibration curve, sensitivity, precision, accuracy, matrix effect, recovery, and stability). Comparing with the SF and NS groups, the combination group did not affect the metabolic pathways of the CNS-related components, however, it decreased the cumulative excretion ratios of HSYA, GRg(1), GRe, and GRd. In conclusion, the compatibility of SF and NS could reduce the bile excretion of the CNS-derived compounds, which may be one of the reasons for the enhancement of anti-myocardial ischemia after combination.

The techniques used to produce whiteleg shrimp in Indonesia are still dominated by conventional rearing strategies using open-pond systems, which often contribute to unpredictable culture performance and weak sustainability. Alternative production strategies of closed aquaculture systems, including the recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) and hybrid zero water discharge-recirculating aquaculture system (hybrid system), have been developed and implemented for higher productivity, stability and sustainability of whiteleg shrimp grow-out production in Indonesia. Despite the positive aspects of the application of closed aquaculture systems in shrimp aquaculture, the differences in the characteristics of shrimp grown in closed RAS and hybrid systems compared to open-pond systems remain unclear. Objective This study aims to investigate the differences in the metabolite profiles of shrimp grown in intensive closed aquaculture systems, including an RAS and hybrid system, compared to those of shrimp grown in a semi-intensive, open, earthen pond system by means of non-targeted GC-MS metabolite profiling. Methods Shrimp cultured in the closed systems (RAS and hybrid system) and an open system (pond) were harvested and subjected to GC-MS non-targeted metabolomics analysis. A total of 112 metabolites were annotated from shrimp samples and subjected to principal component analysis (PCA). Results The metabolites annotated from GC-MS mainly included organic compounds, proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids, sugars, nucleosides and fatty acids. The results of principal component analysis showed several metabolites with high variable importance in projection (VIP) scores, including shikimic acid, beta-alanine, uric acid, hypoxanthine, inosine, homocysteine, methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan and lysine, as the main metabolites differentiating the shrimp grown in the three production systems. Conclusion Our findings showed that shrimp cultured in different aquaculture systems exhibited distinct metabolite profiles, and the metabolites showing high VIP scores, including shikimic acid, beta-alanine, uric acid, hypoxanthine, inosine, homocysteine, methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan and lysine, may serve as candidate markers to indicate the differences in shrimp from different production systems.

Methods Twenty-nine patients with GDM group and 29 PE group who were examined in Tianjin No. 3 Central Hospital from March 2018 to August 2018 were enrolled as case group, and 29 normal pregnant women were selected as control group. All the serum samples were analyzed by using the ultra-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Based on the multivariate statistical analysis method of pattern recognition, we screened out and identified the differential characteristic metabolites. Results The serum metabolic profile model of GDM group and PE group was successfully constructed. A total of nine characteristic metabolites were screened and identified in this study, including LPC 18:0, LPC 22:6, LPC 16:0, (S)-14-methylhexadecanoic acid, behenic acid, palmitic acid, sphingosine, phytosphingosine and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-26,23-lactone. Among them, six characteristic metabolites which were LPC 18:0, LPC 22:6, behenic acid, palmitic acid, sphingosine and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-26,23-lactone all had a significant statistical difference among GDM, PE and normal pregnancy groups (P < 0.05). Conclusion The construction of metabolic profile discriminant model has a strong ability to differentiate GDM patients from PE pregnant women. The screened characteristic metabolites can early reflect the disorder of lipid, calcium and phosphorus metabolism of patients, and provide reference and help for the discussion of the occurrence, development and treatment of diseases.

Based on the severity of inflammation, PPEs can be categorized as early-stage uncomplicated PPE (UPPE), advanced-stage complicated PPE (CPPE) and, most seriously, thoracic empyema. Appropriate antibiotic treatment at the early stage of PPE can prevent PPE progression and reduce mortality, indicating that understanding PPE generation and components can help researchers develop corresponding treatment strategies for PPE. To this end, metabolomes of 73 PPE (38 UPPE and 35 CPPE samples) and 30 malignant pleural effusion (MPE) samples were profiled with differential C-12(2)-/C-13(2)-isotope dansylation labeling-based mass spectrometry. We found that PPE is characterized by elevated levels of dipeptides, especially for PPEs at advanced stages. Furthermore, with integrated proteomic and transcriptomic analyses of PPEs, the levels of dipeptides were strongly associated with the production of interleukin-8 (IL-8), an inflammation-associated cytokine. The production of IL-8 indeed increased upon the treatment of HL-60-derived neutrophilic cells with dipeptides, Gly-Val and Gly-Tyr.

A third of the patients are either misdiagnosed or a proper diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) cannot be made. We need new biomarkers, so that we can offer patients the best treatment and keep the disease in an inactive state for as long as possible. Alterations in metabolic profiles have been incriminated in the pathophysiology of IBD. The aim of the present study was to identify molecules that could serve as biomarkers for a positive diagnosis of IBD as well as to discriminate UC from colonic CD. Twenty-two patients with active colonic IBD (UC =17, CD = 5) and 24 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Plasma lipid and metabolic profiles were quantified using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry. Univariate and multivariate statistical tests were employed. Six lipid species and 7 metabolites were significantly altered in IBD patients compared to healthy controls, with the majority belonging to glycerophospholipid, linoleic acid, and sphingolipid metabolisms. Five lipid species and only i metabolite were significantly increased in UC compared to CD. This preliminary study suggests that lipid and metabolic profiling of serum can become diagnostic tools for IBD. In addition, they can be used to differentiate between CD and UC.

The pretreatment methods affect the coverage and abundance of metabolites, leading to a diversity of results. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a high-coverage and robust pretreatment method to analyze and study resistant-related metabolites (carbohydrates, lipids, and amino acids). The four essential pretreatment steps of Salmonella for the GC/MS-based metabolomics study were optimized, including quenching (methanol-water and liquid nitrogen), solvent extraction (acetonitrile-isopropanol-water, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and methanol-chloroform), cell disruption (stainless-steel ball grinding and liquid nitrogen milling) and derivatization (normal-temperature and high-temperature derivatization). Metabolite profiling was performed to investigate metabolic differences between different methods. The optimized pretreatment method for the non-targeted metabolic profiling of drug-resistant Salmonella was as follows: liquid-nitrogen quenching, acetonitrile-isopropanol-water (3 : 3 : 2, v/v) as an extracting agent, stainless-steel ball grinding for cell disruption and derivatization at 37 degrees C. The optimized pretreatment method will provide more types of metabolites, a higher abundance of metabolites, and better repeatability and stability. The optimized method was implemented for the metabolic profiling of the resistance and sensitivity of Salmonella with serotype Derby. The method has the potential to be applied to the study of the metabolism of other pathogenic bacteria.

Genotypes in Response to Drought Stress	ACS OMEGA			English	Article							PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; POLYAMINE METABOLISM; WHEAT-VARIETIES; OSMOTIC-STRESS; WATER-DEFICIT; LEAVES; SALT; ACCUMULATION; RESISTANCE; REVEAL	Peanut is frequently constrained by extreme environmental conditions such as drought. To reveal the involvement of metabolites, TAG 24 (drought-tolerant) and JL 24 (drought-sensitive) peanut genotypes were investigated under control and 20% PEG 6000-mediated water scarcity conditions at the seedling stage. Samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify untargeted metabolites and targeted metabolites, i.e., polyamines and polyphenols by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), respectively. The principal component analysis (PCA), partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), heat map, and cluster analysis were applied to the metabolomics data obtained by the GC-MS technique to determine the important metabolites for drought tolerance. Among 46 resulting metabolites, pentitol, phytol, xylonic acid, D-xylopyranose, stearic acid, and D-ribose were important drought-responsive metabolites. Agmatine and cadaverine were present in TAG 24 leaves and roots, respectively, during water-deficit conditions and believed to be the potential polyamines for drought tolerance. Polyphenols such as syringic acid and vanillic acid were produced more in the leaves of TAG 24, while catechin production was high in JL 24 during stress conditions. Seven metabolic pathways, namely, galactose metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, fructose and mannose metabolism, pentose and glucuronate interconversion, propanoate metabolism, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids were significantly affected by water-deficit conditions. This study provides valuable information about the metabolic response of peanut to drought stress and metabolites identified, which encourages further study by transcriptome and proteomics to improve drought tolerance in peanut.

Herein, BR was germinated for up to 48 h to prepare germinated brown rice (GBR). The physiological and chemical changes in the GBR during germination were analyzed. GBR samples germinated for 48 h were in the radicle-emergence stage, but root formation was not observed. The change in the GBR metabolite profile during germination was analyzed to determine the effect of germination on the chemical profiles of the GBR samples. Twenty-five metabolites including acidic compounds, amino acids, sugars, lipid metabolites, and secondary metabolites were identified as the components that contributed to the variations in the GBR groups germinated for different time periods. Among the metabolites, the carbohydrates associated with energy production and lipid metabolites changed significantly. Based on the identified metabolites, a metabolomic pathway was proposed. Carbohydrate metabolism, citric acid cycle, and lipid metabolism were the main processes that were affected during germination. Although further studies on the relationship between the metabolite profile and nutritional quality of the GBR are needed, these results are useful for understanding the effect of germination on the physiological and chemical changes in BR.

Their quality control is challenging because every single herb contains hundreds of components (secondary metabolites). A typical 10 herb TCM formula was selected to develop an innovative strategy for its comprehensive chemical characterization and to study the specific contribution of each herb to the formula in an exploratory manner. Metabolite profiling of the TCM formula and the extract of each single herb were acquired with liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry for qualitative analyses, and to evaporative light scattering detection (ELSD) for semi-quantitative evaluation. The acquired data were organized as a feature-based molecular network (FBMN) which provided a comprehensive view of all types of secondary metabolites and their occurrence in the formula and all single herbs. These features were annotated by combining MS/MS-based in silico spectral match, manual evaluation of the structural consistency in the FBMN clusters, and taxonomy information. ELSD detection was used as a filter to select the most abundant features. At least one marker per herb was highlighted based on its specificity and abundance. A single large-scale fractionation from the enriched formula enabled the isolation and formal identification of most of them. The obtained markers allowed an improved annotation of associated features by manually propagating this information through the FBMN. These data were incorporated in the high-resolution metabolite profiling of the formula, which highlighted specific series of related components to each individual herb markers. These series of components, named multi-component signatures, may serve to improve the traceability of each herb in the formula. Altogether, the strategy provided highly informative compositional data of the TCM formula and detailed visualizations of the contribution of each herb by FBMN, filtered feature maps, and reconstituted chromatogram traces of all components linked to each specific marker. This comprehensive MS-based analytical workflow allowed a generic and unbiased selection of specific and abundant markers and the identification of multiple related sub-markers. This exploratory approach could serve as a starting point to develop more simple and targeted quality control methods with adapted marker specificity selection criteria to given TCM formula.

The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration was determined through the broth microdilution method and cell proliferation assay while the Minimum Bactericidal Concentration was determined by Colony Forming Units counts. The characteristics of the antimicrobial compounds were evaluated by pH adjustments, proteinase treatment, and size fractionation of the CFS. The cytotoxicity of CFS was tested on two human cell lines. A detailed snapshot of the L. reuteri metabolism was attained through an untargeted metabolic profiling by means of high resolution Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) coupled with Electrospray Ionization Source (ESI). The results showed (i) a greater efficacy of CFS and its fractions towards Gram-negative compared to Gram-positive bacteria; (ii) an antimicrobial effect related to pH-dependent compounds but not to MVs; (iii) a molecular weight < 3 KDa as well as an a non-proteinaceous nature of the antimicrobial compounds; and (iv) more than 200 and 500 putative metabolites annotated in MVs and supernatants, covering several classes of metabolites, including amino acids, lipids, fatty and organic acids, polyalcohols, nucleotides, and vitamins. Some putative compounds were proposed not only as characteristic of specific fractions, but also possibly involved in antimicrobial activity.

Rose scent from both stages was determined using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) for the first time for Egyptian rose. A total of 75 volatiles were detected, with alcohols, esters, and oxides as valuable volatile classes at ca. 64 %, 10 % and 2 % respectively in ERF compared to 46 %, 2 %, and 0.4 % in URF. Egyptian rose aroma is considered of high quality being enriched in citronellol, geraniol, and phenylethyl alcohol (rose oil). Total flavonoids, phenolics, and anthocyanins were found more enriched in ERF than URF. Further, comprehensive ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/photodiode array detector/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry UHPLC/PDA/ESI-MS revealed 66 secondary metabolites, of which sphingolipid conjugates and tannins are first time to be reported in rose including several novel phenolics viz., gallic acid-di-O-hexoside, galloyl hexose malic acid I, digalloyl-hexosyl-ellagic acid and levoglucosangallate I. Further, in-vitro anti collagenase assay revealed a strong effect for ERF compared to URF and in correlation to its metabolite fingerprint. The strong fragrant scent of Egyptian rose along with its anti-collagenase effect poses it for incorporation in cosmetics and skincare products.

However, the global metabolic responses to high light in general and the relationship between primary metabolism and astaxanthin accumulation in particular are still obscure. In this study, non-targeted metabolomics approach was first to be used to profile the dynamic metabolic changes of H. pluvialis along astaxanthin accumulation under different light intensities, in which > 200 low molecular metabolites were identified. The integration of metabolomics data with previous transcriptomic data uncovered several metabolic pathways including raffinose family oligosaccharides biosynthesis pathway, GSH metabolism pathways, pyrimidine and purine metabolism pathways, TCA cycle, and phospholipids, that are important for astaxanthin biosynthesis under high light intensity, pinpointing a metabolic shift from primary metabolism to astaxanthin biosynthesis. Exogenous application of related metabolites such as nucleotides, carbohydrates and amino acids in algal medium confirmed the metabolic link between primary metabolism and astaxanthin biosynthesis. Our results provides with a solid metabolic base for the manipulation of astaxanthin production under high light stress, and reveals metabolic insights into the adaption strategy of H. pluvialis against light stress conditions.

Early Detection of Cystic Fibrosis Acute Pulmonary Exacerbations by Exhaled Breath Condensate Metabolomics	JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH			English	Article						mass spectrometry; metabolomics; cystic fibrosis; exacerbation	BIOMARKERS; METABOLISM; CARNITINE; BLOOD	The most common cause of death in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is progressive lung function decline, which is punctuated by acute pulmonary exacerbations (APEs). A major challenge is to discover biomarkers for detecting an oncoming APE and allow for pre-emptive clinical interventions. Metabolic profiling of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples collected from CF patients before, during, and after APEs and under stable conditions (n = 210) was performed using ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to Orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS). Negative ion mode MS data showed that classification between metabolic profiles from "pre-APE" (pending APE before the CF patient had any signs of illness) and stable CF samples was possible with good sensitivities (85.7 and 89.5%), specificities (88.4 and 84.1%), and accuracies (87.7 and 85.7%) for pediatric and adult patients, respectively. Improved classification performance was achieved by combining positive with negative ion mode data. Discriminant metabolites included two potential biomarkers identified in a previous pilot study: lactic acid and 4-hydroxycyclohexylcarboxylic acid. Some of the discriminant metabolites had microbial origins, indicating a possible role of bacterial metabolism in APE progression. The results show promise for detecting an oncoming APE using EBC metabolites, thus permitting early intervention to abort such an event.

Untargeted high-resolution plasma metabolomic profiling predicts outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ATHEROTHROMBOTIC RISK STRATIFICATION; ISCHEMIC-HEART-DISEASE; AMINO-ACID-METABOLISM; T-CELL PROLIFERATION; C-REACTIVE PROTEIN; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; DENDRITIC CELLS; TRYPTOPHAN; INHIBITION	Objective Patients with CAD have substantial residual risk of mortality, and whether hitherto unknown small-molecule metabolites and metabolic pathways contribute to this risk is unclear. We sought to determine the predictive value of plasma metabolomic profiling in patients with CAD. Approach and results Untargeted high-resolution plasma metabolomic profiling of subjects undergoing coronary angiography was performed using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Metabolic features and pathways associated with mortality were identified in 454 subjects using metabolome-wide association studies and Mummichog, respectively, and validated in 322 subjects. A metabolomic risk score comprising of log-transformed HR estimates of metabolites that associated with mortality and passed LASSO regression was created and its performance validated. In 776 subjects (66.8 years, 64% male, 17% Black), 433 and 357 features associated with mortality (FDR-adjusted q<0.20); and clustered into 21 and 9 metabolic pathways in first and second cohorts, respectively. Six pathways (urea cycle/amino group, tryptophan, aspartate/asparagine, lysine, tyrosine, and carnitine shuttle) were common. A metabolomic risk score comprising of 7 metabolites independently predicted mortality in the second cohort (HR per 1-unit increase 2.14, 95%CI 1.62, 2.83). Adding the score to a model of clinical predictors improved risk discrimination (delta C-statistic 0.039, 95%CI -0.006, 0.086; and Integrated Discrimination Index 0.084, 95%CI 0.030, 0.151) and reclassification (continuous Net Reclassification Index 23.3%, 95%CI 7.9%, 38.2%). Conclusions Differential regulation of six metabolic pathways involved in myocardial energetics and systemic inflammation is independently associated with mortality in patients with CAD. A novel risk score consisting of representative metabolites is highly predictive of mortality.

The effects of LF on bone formation at the metabolic level have been less explored. Urinary metabolic profiling of growing Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats LF-supplemented (1000 mg/kg bw) for four weeks were explored by Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The serum markers of bone formation and bone resorption, the bone mass, and the osteogenesis markers of femur were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, micro-computerized tomography, and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Compared with the control, LF supplementation improved bone formation (p < 0.05), reduced bone resorption (p < 0.05), enhanced femoral bone mineral density and microarchitecture (p < 0.05), and upregulated osteocalcin, osterix, and Runx-2 expression (p < 0.05) of femur. LF upregulated 69 urinary metabolites. KEGG and pathway enrichment analyses of those urinary metabolites, and the Person's correlation analyses among those urinary metabolites and bone status revealed that LF impacted on bone formation via regulatory comprehensive pathways including taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, cyanoamino acid metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, and fatty acid biosynthesis. The present study indicated the metabolomics is a useful and practical tool to elucidate the mechanisms by which LF augments bone mass formation in growing animals.

These data were used as a clue for the identification of metabolites of the recently reported isatin-based antiproliferative agent, namely, N'-[5-bromo-1-methyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-3H-indol-3-ylidene]-5-methoxy-1H-indole-2-carbohyclrazide (1) in rat liver micro-somes (RLMs) using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Prediction of the vulnerable sites for metabolic pathways in compound 1 was performed by WhichP450 module of StarDrop software. In vitro metabolites for compound 1 were identified with the aid of rat liver microsomes. The in silico data were utilized as a guide for the practical work. Compound 1 was metabolized into three (hydroxylated, reduced and 0-demethylated) metabolites in RLMs in the presence of NADPH. The chemical structures of those metabolites were elucidated, and the metabolic pathways were proposed by comparing the fragmentation pattern of the isatin-indole conjugates 1-7. The data presented in this paper provided useful information on the effect of different substituents on the ionization/fragmentation processes and can be used in the characterization of isatin derivatives.

The metabolic profile of the three extracts was analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with electrospray ionization high-resolution mass spectrometric (ESI-HRMS-MS). Mass spectrometry-based molecular networking was employed to aid in metabolites annotation and for the visual investigation of the known metabolites and their analogues. The study led to the tentative identification of 45 metabolites including amino acids, purine derivatives, phenolic acids, flavonoids, fatty acids, and an alkaloid, articulating 24 compounds as a first time report from beet leaves along with 2 new putatively identified compounds: a flavone feruloyl conjugate (39) and a malonylated acacetin diglycoside (40). The three extracting systems exhibited comparable efficiency for pulling out the secondary metabolites from the beet leaves. The in vitro study supported this finding and demonstrated that the three extracts inhibited the activity of both pancreatic alpha-amylase and lipase enzymes with no significant difference observed regarding the percentage of the inhibition of the enzymes. Conclusively, the extraction protocol has a minimal effect on the anti-obesity properties of beet leaves. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Cairo University.

The comprehensive bioactive compounds profile and antioxidant capacities of mamey apple (Mammea americana), camapu (Physalis angulata), and uxi (Endopleura uchi) was determined for the first time. Bioactive compounds were characterized by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-MSE) in aqueous and ethanolic extracts. Globally, a total of 293 metabolites were tentatively identified in mamey apple, campau, and uxi extracts. The main classes of compounds in the three species were terpenoids (61), phenolic acids (58), and flavonoids (53). Ethanolic extracts of fruits showed higher antioxidant activity and total ion abundance of bioactive compounds than aqueous. Uxi had the highest values of phenolic content (701.84 mg GAE/100 g), ABTS (1602.7 mu mol Trolox g(-1)), and ORAC (15.04 mu mol Trolox g(-1)). Mamey apple had the highest results for DPPH (1168.42 mu mol TE g(-1)) and FRAP (1381.13 mu mol FSE g(-1)). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy results showed that sugars and lipids were the substances with the highest amounts in mamey apple and camapu. Data referring to chemical characteristics and antioxidant capacity of these fruits can contribute to their economic exploitation.

Shallot landraces and varieties are considered an important genetic resource for Allium breeding due to their high contents of several functional metabolites. Aiming to provide new genetic materials for the development of a novel bulb onion cultivar derived from intraspecific hybrids with useful agronomic traits from shallots, the metabolic profiles in the bulbs of 8 Indonesian shallot landraces and 7 short-day and 3 long-day bulb onion cultivars were established using LC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. Principal component analysis, partial least squares discriminant analysis, and dendrogram clustering analysis showed two major groups; group I contained all shallot landraces and group II contained all bulb onion cultivars, indicating that shallots exhibited a distinct metabolic profile in comparison with bulb onions. Variable importance in the projection and Spearman's rank correlation indicated that free and conjugated amino acids, flavonoids (especially metabolites having flavonol aglycone), and anthocyanins, as well as organic acids, were among the top metabolite variables that were highly associated with shallot landraces. The absolute quantification of 21 amino acids using conventional HPLC analysis showed high contents in shallots rather than in bulb onions. The present study indicated that shallots reprogrammed their metabolism toward a high accumulation of amino acids and flavonoids as an adaptive mechanism in extremely hot tropical environments.

STW 5 is a clinically proven treatment for functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome. Purpose: Using a static in vitro method, we simulated oral, gastric, and small intestinal digestion and analyzed the metabolic profile changes by UHPLC-HRMS to determine the impact of oro-gastro-intestinal digestion on STW 5 constituents. Study Design and Methods: STW 5 was incubated according to the InfoGest consensus method. Samples of each digestive phase were analyzed by UHPLC-HRMS in ESI positive and negative modes. After data processing, background subtraction, and normalization, the peak areas of detectable compounds were compared to untreated reference samples and recovery ratios were calculated to monitor the metabolic profile of STW 5 during simulated digestion. Results: Although the levels of some constituents were reduced, we did not observe complete degradation of any of the constituents of STW 5 upon in vitro digestion. We did not detect any new metabolites beyond increased levels of caffeic acid and liquiritigenin due to degradation of progenitor compounds. Changes observed in intestinal bioaccessibility ratios were mainly a result of isomerization, hydrolysis, protein binding, and low water solubility. Conclusion: The majority of STW 5 constituents are stable towards simulated in vitro digestion and can reach the colon to interact with gut microbiota if they remain unabsorbed in the upper intestinal tract.

MDM2-Dependent Rewiring of Metabolomic and Lipidomic Profiles in Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma Models	CANCERS			English	Article						dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS); metabolomics; lipidomics; MDM2; sphingolipid metabolism; atorvastatin; chemosensitivity	MASS-SPECTROMETRY; CANCER; MDM2; QUANTIFICATION; INHIBITION; SYNTHASE; PLATFORM; KEGG	Dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS) is an aggressive mesenchymal cancer marked by amplification of MDM2, an inhibitor of the tumor suppressor TP53. DDLPS patients with higher MDM2 amplification have lower chemotherapy sensitivity and worse outcome than patients with lower MDM2 amplification. We hypothesized that MDM2 amplification levels may be associated with changes in DDLPS metabolism. Six patient-derived DDLPS cell line models were subject to comprehensive metabolomic (Metabolon) and lipidomic (SCIEX 5600 TripleTOF-MS) profiling to assess associations with MDM2 amplification and their responses to metabolic perturbations. Comparing metabolomic profiles between MDM2 higher and lower amplification cells yielded a total of 17 differentially abundant metabolites across both panels (FDR < 0.05, log2 fold change < 0.75), including ceramides, glycosylated ceramides, and sphingomyelins. Disruption of lipid metabolism through statin administration resulted in a chemo-sensitive phenotype in MDM2 lower cell lines only, suggesting that lipid metabolism may be a large contributor to the more aggressive nature of MDM2 higher DDLPS tumors. This study is the first to provide comprehensive metabolomic and lipidomic characterization of DDLPS cell lines and provides evidence for MDM2-dependent differential molecular mechanisms that are critical factors in chemoresistance and could thus affect patient outcome.

BC is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Although various molecular diagnostic tools have been developed to improve diagnosis of BC in the clinical setting, better detection tools for earlier diagnosis can improve survival rates. Given that altered metabolism is a characteristic feature of BC, we aimed to understand the comparative metabolic differences between BC and healthy controls. Metabolomics, the study of metabolism, can provide incredible insight and create useful tools for identifying potential BC biomarkers. In this study, we applied two analytical mass spectrometry (MS) platforms, including hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) and gas chromatography (GC), to generate BC-associated metabolic profiles using breast tissue from BC patients. These metabolites were further analyzed to identify differentially expressed metabolites in BC and their associated metabolic networks. Additionally, Chemical Similarity Enrichment Analysis (ChemRICH), MetaMapp, and Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis (MSEA) identified significantly enriched clusters and networks in BC tissues. Since metabolomic signatures hold significant promise in the clinical setting, more effort should be placed on validating potential BC biomarkers based on identifying altered metabolomes.

Hsiao is one of the most common herbs widely used in South and East Asia, to enhance people's health and reinforce vital energy. Despite its prevalence, however, the knowledge about phytochemical compositions and metabolite biosynthesis in Astragalus membranaceus Bge. var. mongolicus (Bge.) Hsiao is very limited. Results An integrated metabolomics and transcriptomics analysis using state-of-the-art UPLC-Q-Orbitrap mass spectrometer and advanced bioinformatics pipeline were conducted to study global metabolic profiles and phytochemical ingredients/biosynthesis in Astragalus membranaceus Bge. var. mongolicus (Bge.) Hsiao. A total of 5435 metabolites were detected, from which 2190 were annotated, representing an order of magnitude increase over previously known. Metabolic profiling of Astragalus membranaceus Bge. var. mongolicus (Bge.) Hsiao tissues found contents and synthetic enzymes for phytochemicals were significantly higher in leaf and stem in general, whereas the contents of the main bioactive ingredients were significantly enriched in root, underlying the value of root in herbal remedies. Using integrated metabolomics and transcriptomics data, we illustrated the complete pathways of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, and isoflavonoid biosynthesis, in which some were first reported in the herb. More importantly, we discovered novel flavonoid derivatives using informatics method for neutral loss scan, in addition to inferring their likely synthesis pathways in Astragalus membranaceus Bge. var. mongolicus (Bge.) Hsiao. Conclusions The current study represents the most comprehensive metabolomics and transcriptomics analysis on traditional herb Astragalus membranaceus Bge. var. mongolicus (Bge.) Hsiao.

In this study, we aimed to detect the alteration of metabolite profiles, explore the correlation between serum metabolites and inflammatory markers, and seek potential biomarkers for young adults with CAP. 13 Eligible young mild CAP patients between the ages of 18 and 30 years old with CURB65 = 0 admitted to the respiratory medical department were enrolled, along with 36 healthy participants as control. Untargeted metabolomics profiling was performed and metabolites including alcohols, amino acids, carbohydrates, fatty acids, etc. were detected. A total of 227 serum metabolites were detected. L-Alanine, 2-Hydroxybutyric acid, Methylcysteine, L-Phenylalanine, Aminoadipic acid, L-Tryptophan, Rhamnose, Palmitoleic acid, Decanoylcarnitine, 2-Hydroxy-3-methylbutyric acid and Oxoglutaric acid were found to be significantly altered, which were enriched mainly in propanoate and tryptophan metabolism, as well as antibiotic-associated pathways. Aminoadipic acid was found to be significantly correlated with CRP levels and 2-Hydroxy-3-methylbutyric acid and Palmitoleic acid with PCT levels. The top 3 metabolites of diagnostic values are 2-Hydroxybutyric acid(AUC = 0.90), Methylcysteine(AUC = 0.85), and L-Alanine(AUC = 0.84). The AUC for CRP and PCT are 0.93 and 0.91 respectively. Altered metabolites were correlated with inflammation severity and were of great diagnostic value for CAP.

However, it is unclear if this metabolomic profile corresponds to changes in brain morphology as observed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The aim of this study was to explore how circulating serum metabolites, following TBI, relate to structural MRI (sMRI) findings. Serum samples were collected upon admission to the emergency department from patients suffering from acute TBI and metabolites were measured using mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Most of these patients sustained a mild TBI. In the same patients, sMRIs were taken and volumetric data were extracted (138 metrics). From a pool of 203 eligible screened patients, 96 met the inclusion criteria for this study. Metabolites were summarized as eight clusters and sMRI data were reduced to 15 independent components (ICs). Partial correlation analysis showed that four metabolite clusters had significant associations with specific ICs, reflecting both the grey and white matter brain injury. Multiple machine learning approaches were then applied in order to investigate if circulating metabolites could distinguish between positive and negative sMRI findings. A logistic regression model was developed, comprised of two metabolic predictors (erythronic acid and myo-inositol), which, together with neurofilament light polypeptide (NF-L), discriminated positive and negative sMRI findings with an area under the curve of the receiver-operating characteristic of 0.85 (specificity = 0.89, sensitivity = 0.65). The results of this study show that metabolomic analysis of blood samples upon admission, either alone or in combination with protein biomarkers, can provide valuable information about the impact of TBI on brain structural changes.

To unravel the effects and underlying mechanisms of Qianggan formula on hyperglycemia, we administrated Qianggan extract to high fat and high sucrose (HFHS) diet rats. Results showed that four-week Qianggan extract intervention significantly decreased serum fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and liver glycogen levels. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) approach was employed to explore metabolomic profiles in liver and fecal samples. By multivariate and univariate statistical analysis (variable importance of projection value > 1 and p value < 0.05), 44 metabolites (18 in liver and 30 in feces) were identified as significantly different. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed that most differential metabolites had opposite patterns between pair-wise groups. Qianggan extract restored the diet induced metabolite perturbations. Metabolite sets enrichment and pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the affected metabolites were mainly enriched in glycometabolism pathways such as glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway, fructose, and mannose metabolism. By compound-reaction-enzyme-gene network analysis, batches of genes (e.g. Hk1, Gck, Rpia, etc) or enzymes (e.g. hexokinase and glucokinase) related to metabolites in enriched pathways were obtained. Our findings demonstrated that Qianggan extract alleviated hyperglycemia, and the effects might be partially due to the regulation of glycometabolism related pathways.

This urease pretreatment has been the key step of sample preparation for standard urinary metabolomics until today even for mass spectrometry-based analysis. The urease pretreatment involving incubation of urine with urease contradicts the concept of metabolome sampling, which should immediately arrest metabolic reactions to prevent alterations of a metabolite profile. Nonetheless, the impact of urease pretreatment has not been clearly elucidated yet. We found that activities of urease and endogenous urinary enzymes and metabolite contaminants from the urease preparations introduce artefacts into metabolite profiles, thus leading to misinterpretation.

Paul; Salman, Dahlia			VOCCluster: Untargeted Metabolomics Feature Clustering Approach for Clinical Breath Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry Data	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							IDENTIFICATION; METABOLITES; ALGORITHMS; SPECTRA	Metabolic profiling of breath analysis involves processing, alignment, scaling, and clustering of thousands of features extracted from gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) data from hundreds of participants. The multistep data processing is complicated, operator error-prone, and time-consuming. Automated algorithmic clustering methods that are able to cluster features in a fast and reliable way are necessary. These accelerate metabolic profiling and discovery platforms for next-generation medical diagnostic tools. Our unsupervised clustering technique, VOCCluster, prototyped in Python, handles features of deconvolved GC/MS breath data. VOCCluster was created from a heuristic ontology based on the observation of experts undertaking data processing with a suite of software packages. VOCCluster identifies and clusters groups of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from deconvolved GC/MS breath with similar mass spectra and retention index profiles. VOCCluster was used to cluster more than 15 000 features extracted from 74 GC/MS clinical breath samples obtained from participants with cancer before and after a radiation therapy. Results were evaluated against a panel of ground truth compounds and compared to other clustering methods (DBSCAN and OPTICS) that were used in previous metabolomics studies. VOCCluster was able to cluster those features into 1081 groups (including endogenous and exogenous compounds and instrumental artifacts) with an accuracy rate of 96% (+/- 0.04 at 95% confidence interval).

Methods and results Untargeted mass-spectrometry-based metabolomics is applied to explore the impact of red and processed meat consumption (compared to chicken), combined with a prudent or Western dietary pattern. A pig feeding study (n = 32), as a sentinel for humans, is conducted in a 2 x 2 factorial design for 4 weeks. The luminal content of the small intestine and colon are collected to determine their metabolic fingerprints. Seventy-six metabolites (38 in the small intestine, 32 in the colon, and 6 in both intestinal compartments) contributing to the distinct gut metabolic profiles of pigs fed either chicken or red and processed meat are (tentatively) identified. Consumption of red and processed meat results in higher levels of short- and medium-chain acylcarnitines and 3-dehydroxycarnitine, irrespective of dietary context, whereas long-chain acylcarnitines and monoacylglycerols are associated with the red and processed Western diet. Conclusion The identification of red and processed meat-associated gut metabolites in this study contributes to the understanding of meat digestion in a complex but controlled dietary context and its potential health effects.

We, therefore, aimed to delineate the role of secondary metabolites synthesized and released by pasture legumes through a series of studies to: 1) characterize key metabolites present in plant tissues, residue and the rhizosphere and 2) correlate their presence with weed suppressive properties. Methods Field and in vitro experimentations coupled with targeted and non-targeted metabolic profiling was performed to evaluate the abundance of key phytotoxic metabolites using UHPLC QTOF-MS. Further, those metabolites strongly correlated with weed suppression and phytotoxicity were predicted by chemometric analyses and their concentration evaluated in field soils collected from the same legume site. Results Field experimentation, methanolic extracts and dried residues of Biserrula pelecinus L. and Ornithopus compressus L. exhibited marked phytotoxicity in a series of laboratory experiments. Metabolic profiling revealed that both foliar tissues and rhizosphere soils of pasture legumes possessed a high abundance of flavonoids and their precursors. Chemometric analyses suggested the strong association of quercetin, isoquercetin, kaempferol, and kaempferol-7-O-glucoside with weed suppression under field conditions. Specifically, the abundance of quercetin and kaempferol was significantly higher in soils collected from established stands of biserrula and yellow serradella in contrast to arrowleaf, gland and subterranean clover. Conclusion Current study provided an evidence for the role of certain annual legume-produced flavonoids in weed suppression in southern Australia and further insight into their localization and release in the soil rhizosphere.

Epigallocatechin gallate was the main catechin derivative, followed by epigallocatechin and catechin presented in HGT, which contained high levels of free amino acids (50.30 +/- 0.60 mg/g). HGT significantly alleviated glucose and insulin intolerance, reduced hepatic lipid accumulation and liver steatosis, and prevented white adipose tissue expansion in HFD-fed mice. Untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics analysis revealed that HGT reduced the abundance of fecal branched-chain amino acids, aromatic amino acids, sphingolipids, and most acyl cholines, modulated bile acid metabolism by increasing chenodeoxycholate and reducing cholic acid content, and increased unsaturated fatty acids content. Fatherly, HGT activated insulin/ PI3K/Akt and AMPK signaling pathways in the liver, reduced adipogenic and lipogenic genes expression, and promoted the genes expression related to lipolysis and adipocyte browning in white adipose tissue, contributed to improving metabolic syndrome in HFD-fed mice. The current study reported the impact of HGT supplementation on endogenous metabolite profiles, and highlights the positive roles of HGT in preventing diet-induced obesity and the related metabolic disorders.

Hereby, feces represents a unique biospecimen as it integrates the complex interactions between the diet, gut microbiome and host, and is therefore ideally suited to study the involvement of the diet-gut microbiome axis in metabolic diseases and their treatments at a molecular level. We present a new method for rapid ( < 10 s) metabolic fingerprinting of feces, i.e. laser-assisted rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (LA-REIMS) with an Nd:YAG laser (2940 nm) and quadrupole Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer as main components. The LA-REIMS method was implemented on mimicked crude feces samples from individuals that were assigned a state of type 2 diabetes or euglycaemia. Based on the generated fingerprints, enclosing 4923 feature ions, significant segregation according to disease classification was achieved through orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (Q(2) (Y) of 0.734 and p-value of 1.93e(-17)) and endorsed by a general classification accuracy of 90.5%. A comparison between the discriminative performance of the novel LA-REIMS and our established ultra-high performance liquid-chromatography high-resolution MS (UHPLC-HRMS) metabolomics and lipidomics methodologies for fingerprinting of stool was performed. Based on the supervised modelling results upon UHPLC-HRMS (Q(2) (Y) >= 0.655 and p-value <= 4.11 e(-5)), equivalent or better discriminative performance of LA-REIMS fingerprinting was concluded. Eventually, comprehensive UHPLC-HRMS was employed to assess metabolic alterations as observed for the defined classes, whereby metformin treatment of the type 2 diabetes patients was considered a relevant study factor to acquire new mechanistic insights. More specifically, ten metabolization products of metformin were identified, with (hydroxylated) triazepinone and metformin-cholesterol reported for the first time in vivo.In conclusion, LA-REIMS was established as an expedient strategy for rapid metabolic fingerprinting of feces, whereby potential implementations may relate, but are not limited to differential diagnosis and treatment efficacy evaluation of metabolic diseases. Yet, LC-HRMS remains essential for in-depth biological interpretation.

We aim to map a comprehensive genomic and metabolomic profile of a consanguineous Chinese family with ARB. Methods Ophthalmic examinations were performed on the affected patients with ARB. The proband was screened for potential causative mutations in a panel with 256 known retinal disease genes by using target capture sequencing. The related mutation was further validated and segregated in the family members by Sanger sequencing. In silico prediction tools were used for pathogenicity assessment. A UHPLC-MS/MS metabolomic analysis was performed to explore the disease-associated metabolic feature. Results The affected patients from this family were characterized by low vision, the presence of subretinal fluid, macular edema, and hyperopia with coincidental angle closure. DNA sequencing identified a novel missense mutation in the BEST1 gene c.646G > A (p.Val216Ile) of the proband. Sanger sequencing further confirmed the mutation. The missense mutation was co-segregation across the pedigree and predicted to be deleterious by SIFT (0.017). The blood metabolic profiles were highly similar among all family members probably because of the same lifestyle, habitat and genomic background. However, ARB patients presented a significant deregulation of metabolites, such as citric acid, L-Threonic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid. Conclusions We identified a novel disease-associated variant in the BEST1 gene as well as a disease-specific metabolic feature in familial ARB. Our findings helped improve the understanding of ARB mechanisms.

Moreover, once introduced into the environment, pesticides are degraded to many compounds with undefined bioactivity. In presented work, under experimental conditions, model edible plant (Raphanus sativus var. longipinnatus) was exposed to herbicide stress by application of a herbicide (mesotrione, 2-(4-methanesulfonyl-2-nitrobenzoyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, MES) or its degradation products (amino-4-(methylsulfonyl)benzoic acid, AMBA; 4-(methylsulfonyl)-2-nitrobenzoic acid MNBA; cyclohexane-1,3-dione, CHD). Metabolic profiles of plants were employed to estimate the plant's defence response to MES and its metabolites. The intensity of herbicide stress was determined by measuring the changes in chlorophyll and catecholamines concentration formed in the shikimic acid pathway. Non-target analysis was conducted by LC-MS/MS, determination of catecholamines by LC-FL, chlorophyll by spectrophotometry. The highest phytotoxicity is characterized by MES (2000%-fold increase in the content of herbicide stress marker (normetanephrine) compared to a blank), followed by CHD (500%) combined with 15% increase in chlorophyll concentration. AMBA and MNBA as stress factors caused the increase in the content of catecholamines in the plant (86-160%). Simultaneously, an increase in chlorophyll content was observed (26-50%). Such diversity of the organism's defence response, also visible on metabolic profiles, can be associated with the chemical structure of compounds that are stress factors. MES and CHD, in contrast to AMBA and MNBA, have cyclohexano-1,3-moiety in their structure, which seems to be responsible for herbicidal properties. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to characterize the osteoprotective effect ofL. sativumin an ovariectomized rat model at two dose levels (50 and 100 mg/kg) using 17 beta-estradiol as a positive reference standard. Moreover, a complete metabolite profile ofL. sativumvia UHPLC/PDA/ESI-MS, as well as headspace solid-phase microextraction (SPME)-GC/MS is presented. Results revealed thatL. sativumextract exhibited significant anti-osteoporotic actions as evidenced by mitigating the decrease in relative bone weight concurrent with improved longitudinal and perpendicular femur compression strength. Further, the extract enhanced the serum bone formation biomarkers lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and osteocalcin levels. The extract also inhibited exhaustion of superoxide dismutase (SOD) as well as glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and accumulation of lipid peroxides in bone tissues. This is in addition to ameliorating the rise in the markers of bone resorption carboxyterminal telopeptide, type I (CTXI) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and modulating receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-Beta ligand (RANKL)/ osteoprotegerin (OPG) expression. Metabolite characterization suggests that glucosinolates, lignans, coumarins, phenolic acids, and alkaloids mediate these anti-osteoporotic effects in a synergistic manner.

Tomatoes were flash frozen, cryosectioned and imaged with adequate spatial resolution to distinguish between the major tissue structures of a tomato including the skin, mesocarp, endocarp, locular tissue, septum, placenta, seed and seed coating. Metabolites were imaged from 100-1200m/z, enabling significant coverage of a diverse array of metabolites including amino acids and lipids along with the major secondary metabolite classes: terpenes, phenolics, glycosides, and alkaloids. During the metabolic profiling, we found endogenous carotenoid hydrocarbons, namely lycopene or its structural isomer beta-carotene, ionized as radical cations.

Schum. ex Vaupel) Britton & Rose (Cactaceae) is a shrubby or often arborescent cactus popularly known as "sancayo" and produce an edible fruit known as "Sanky" which is consumed in Arequipa-Peru. The purpose of this study was to report the gastroprotective activity and relate this activity to the antioxidant capacity and presence of phenolic compounds for the first time. A metabolomic profiling based on Ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography and electrospray high resolution mass spectrometry, and the antioxidant activities (DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP), ascorbic acid content, total phenolics and flavonoids contents, and the mode of gastroprotective action of the Sanky fruit including the involvement of prostaglandins, nitric oxide, and sulfhydryl compounds is reported. Thirty-eight compounds were detected in the ethanolic extract including 12 organic acids, nine hydroxycinnamic acids, three isoamericanol derivatives, six flavonoids, five fatty acids, and two sterols. The results of the biological tests showed that the ethanolic extract had antioxidant capacity and gastroprotective activity on the model of HCl/EtOH-induced gastric lesions in mice (at 10, 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg). The effect elicited by the extract at 50 mg/kg was reversed by indometacin and N-ethylmaleimide but not by N-G-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester suggesting that sulfhydryl groups and prostaglandins are involved in the mode of gastroprotective action. In conclusion, our study proves that C. brevistylus pears have some gastroprotective and antioxidant capacities and consumption is recommended for the presence of several bioactive compounds.

Legal regulation of SCs requires fundamental analytical studies regarding the differentiation of potential structural isomers. Accumulation of SC metabolic profiles is also essential for forensic investigation because SCs are immediately metabolized after intake. Thus, we investigated the in vitro metabolism ofN-adamantyl-1-(tetrahydropyran-4-ylmethyl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamide isomers (ATHs) using human liver microsomes (HLMs). Moreover, we validated the applicability of the isomeric differentiation by investigation ofN-adamantyl-1-(4-fluorobenzyl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamide isomers (AFUs). Methods Metabolites were collected at designated time points during the incubation period with HLMs for up to 180 min. The structures of the metabolites were annotated on the basis of mass spectroscopic evidence obtained by liquid chromatography-ion trap-time of flight mass spectrometry. Results The secondary stage mass (MS2) spectra obtained from the protonated molecules revealed a clear difference in both ATHs and their major metabolites because of the stability of the adamantyl (AD) cation. In HLMs, ATHs were quickly metabolized, and hydroxylation of the AD ring was deduced as the major metabolic pathway. The major metabolites of ATH 1 and ATH 2 after 180 min showed dihydroxylation and monohydroxylation of the AD ring. The AFUs showed analytical and metabolic profiles similar to those of the ATHs described above. Conclusions We characterized the metabolism of ATHs for the first time and discriminated between the two isomers by mass spectrometric analysis of either the parent compounds or their major metabolites. Our investigation of AFUs also demonstrated a useful method for distinguishing between AD isomers.

However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. In the present study, integrated transcriptomic and metabolomics analysis of mouse liver was performed in combination with serum biochemical and histopathological evaluation to investigate the potential mechanism. The results suggested that 640 mg/kg DTN significantly increased serum alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels and induced serious cellular degeneration, with no changes occurring with 4 mg/kg DTN. Integrated analysis suggested that the metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, drug metabolism-other enzymes, bile secretion and glutathione metabolism were the major metabolic pathways involved in DTN-induced hepatotoxicity. Notably, 640 mg/kg DTN exposure increased hepatic GSH, GSH peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde, and decreased ROS, together with altered expression of Idh2 and Nedd9. Representative genes, including Mup12, Lipc, NTCP, MRP3, MRP4, CYP2E1, CYP2D9 and UGT1A9, in altered pathways were verified through PCR and Western blot. Collectively, the combined strategy of transcriptomics and metabolomics profiling could facilitate a better understanding for the discovery of metabolic pathways and that oxidative damage, ABC transporters and lipid metabolism might be the mechanisms linked to DTN-induced hepatotoxicity in mice. Significance: Dictamnine (DTN) was reported to induce hepatotoxicity. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism is unknown. This study is the first to utilize integrated transcriptomics and metabolomics in combination with general toxicity evaluation to characterize the potential molecular mechanism in DTN-induced hepatotoxicity in mice. We found that acute exposure to higher dose of DTN induced hepatocellular liver injury with more changes in biochemical parameters, genes and metabolites. Gene expression and metabolite profiles were more sensitive than general toxicity studies for detecting earlier hepatotoxicity. Integrated analysis suggested that oxidative damage, ABC transporters and lipid metabolism were closely correlated with DTN-induced hepatotoxicity. Overall, our results provide insights into the mechanism responsible for DTN-induced hepatotoxicity.

The present study represents an attempt to characterize the metabolic profile of a microalgal diatomChaetoceros calcitrans, by applying high-resolution mass spectrometry detection, via Q-ExactiveTM Plus Orbitrap mass spectrometry. The results showed that 54 metabolites of various classes were tentatively identified. Experimentally, the chloroform and acetone extracts were clearly distinguished from other solvent extracts in chemometric regression analysis using PLS, showing the differences in theC. calcitransmetabolome between the groups. In addition, specific metabolites were evaluated, which supported the finding of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. This study also provides data on the quantitative analysis of four carotenoids based on the identification results. Therefore, these findings could serve as a reliable tool for identifying and quantifying the metabolome that could reflect the metabolic activities ofC. calcitrans.

In this study, we used proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (H-1-NMR) Spectroscopy and multivariate data analysis to profile the serum metabolome of 64 HCC patients, in early (n = 28) and advanced (n = 36) disease stages. We found that H-1-NMR metabolomics profiling could discriminate early from advanced HCC patients with a cross-validated accuracy close to 100%. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) showed significant changes in serum glucose, lactate, lipids and some amino acids, such as alanine, glutamine, 1-methylhistidine, lysine and valine levels between advanced and early HCC patients. Moreover, in early HCC patients, Kaplan-Meier analysis highlighted the serum tyrosine level as a predictor for overall survival (OS). Overall, our analysis identified a set of metabolites with possible clinical and biological implication in HCC pathophysiology.

The goal of this study was to analyse the biochemical profiles of embryonic fluids and blood plasma of rabbits with and without insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (DT1), to identify metabolic changes associated with maternal diabetes mellitus in early pregnancy. Insulin-dependent diabetes was induced by alloxan treatment in female rabbits 10 days before mating. On day 6 post-coitum, plasma and blastocoel fluid (BF) were analysed by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (UPLC-MS/MS) (Metabolon Inc. Durham, NC, USA). Metabolic datasets comprised a total of 284 and 597 compounds of known identity in BF and plasma, respectively. Diabetes mellitus had profound effects on maternal and embryonic metabolic profiles, with almost half of the metabolites changed. As predicted, we observed an increase in glucose and a decrease in 1,5-anhydroglucitol in diabetic plasma samples. In plasma, fructose, mannose, and sorbitol were elevated in the diabetic group, which may be a way of dealing with excess glucose. In BF, metabolites of the pentose metabolism were especially increased, indicating the need for ribose-based compounds relevant to DNA and RNA metabolism at this very early stage of embryo development. Other changes were more consistent between BF and plasma. Both displayed elevated acylcarnitines, body3-hydroxybutyrate, and multiple compounds within the branched chain amino acid metabolism pathway, suggesting that lipid beta-oxidation is occurring at elevated levels in the diabetic group. This study demonstrates that maternal and embryonic metabolism are closely related. Maternal diabetes mellitus profoundly alters the metabolic profile of the preimplantation embryo with changes in all subclasses of metabolites.

Differential kynurenine pathway metabolism in highly metastatic aggressive breast cancer subtypes: beyond IDO1-induced immunosuppression	BREAST CANCER RESEARCH			English	Article						Kynurenine pathway; Breast cancer; Biomarker; Immune evasion; Tryptophan	3-HYDROXYANTHRANILIC ACID; CORE NEEDLE; HER2 STATUS; RECEPTOR; CELLS; PROLIFERATION; DEGRADATION; SUPPRESSOR; INHIBITORS; PREDICTS	Background Immunotherapy has recently been proposed as a promising treatment to stop breast cancer (BrCa) progression and metastasis. However, there has been limited success in the treatment of BrCa with immune checkpoint inhibitors. This implies that BrCa tumors have other mechanisms to escape immune surveillance. While the kynurenine pathway (KP) is known to be a key player mediating tumor immune evasion and while there are several studies on the roles of the KP in cancer, little is known about KP involvement in BrCa. Methods To understand how KP is regulated in BrCa, we examined the KP profile in BrCa cell lines and clinical samples (n = 1997) that represent major subtypes of BrCa (luminal, HER2-enriched, and triple-negative (TN)). We carried out qPCR, western blot/immunohistochemistry, and ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography on these samples to quantify the KP enzyme gene, protein, and activity, respectively. Results We revealed that the KP is highly dysregulated in the HER2-enriched and TN BrCa subtype. Gene, protein expression, and KP metabolomic profiling have shown that the downstream KP enzymes KMO and KYNU are highly upregulated in the HER2-enriched and TN BrCa subtypes, leading to increased production of the potent immunosuppressive metabolites anthranilic acid (AA) and 3-hydroxylanthranilic acid (3HAA). Conclusions Our findings suggest that KMO and KYNU inhibitors may represent new promising therapeutic targets for BrCa. We also showed that KP metabolite profiling can be used as an accurate biomarker for BrCa subtyping, as we successfully discriminated TN BrCa from other BrCa subtypes.

Metabolic Profiling of PGPR-Treated Tomato Plants Reveal Priming-Related Adaptations of Secondary Metabolites and Aromatic Amino Acids	METABOLITES			English	Article						chemometrics; metabolomics; metabolic reprogramming; plant defense; plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria; priming	GROWTH-PROMOTING RHIZOBACTERIA; PROGRAMMED CELL-DEATH; DEFENSE RESPONSES; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; ALPHA-TOMATINE; GETTING READY; IDENTIFICATION; RESISTANCE; GLYCOALKALOIDS; BIOSYNTHESIS	Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are beneficial microbes in the rhizosphere that can directly or indirectly stimulate plant growth. In addition, some can prime plants for enhanced defense against a broad range of pathogens and insect herbivores. In this study, four PGPR strains (Pseudomonas fluorescens N04, P. koreensis N19, Paenibacillus alvei T19, and Lysinibacillus sphaericus T22) were used to induce priming in Solanum lycopersicum (cv. Moneymaker) plants. Plants were inoculated with each of the four PGPRs, and plant tissues (roots, stems, and leaves) were harvested at 24 h and 48 h post-inoculation. Methanol-extracted metabolites were analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS). Chemometric methods were applied to mine the data and characterize the differential metabolic profiles induced by the PGPR. The results revealed that all four strains induced defense-related metabolic reprogramming in the plants, characterized by dynamic changes to the metabolomes involving hydroxycinnamates, benzoates, flavonoids, and glycoalkaloids. In addition, targeted analysis of aromatic amino acids indicated differential quantitative increases or decreases over a two-day period in response to the four PGPR strains. The metabolic alterations point to an altered or preconditioned state that renders the plants primed for enhanced defense responses. The results contribute to ongoing efforts in investigating and unraveling the biochemical processes that define the PGPR priming phenomenon.

Increased arginase activity is associated with cardiovascular disease. The literature shows that plants are a good source of arginase inhibitors. Hence in the present work arginase inhibitor activity is studied fromFicus religiosaleaves. A fine powder ofF. religiosaleaves was serially extracted in various solvents, viz. hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol. Out of those four solvent extracts, the one showing highest arginase inhibitor activity was loaded onto the column for further fractionation. Among the collected fractions, the one showing the highest activity was subjected to identification of metabolites by using LC-HRMS. Total compounds including acipimox, edoxudine, levulinic acid, hydroxyhydroquinone, ramiprilglucuronide, berberine, antimycin A, swietenine and some short peptides were identified from the fraction showing the highest arginase inhibitory activity. Identification of these metabolites fromF. religiosaand their biological importance may help to promote its use as medicinal plant. Further purification and characterization of therapeutically novel molecules will be the subject of future work.

Previously, the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 was engineered to produce 1-butanol through the introduction of a modified CoA-dependent pathway. S. elongatus strain DC11, a high producer of 1-butanol, was constructed based on metabolomics-assisted strain engineering. DC11 can reach a production titer of 418.7 mg/L in 6 days, cutting the production time in half compared to the previously constructed DC7. Regardless, the final 1-butanol titer of DC11 was still low compared to other microbial hosts. Sensitivity towards 1-butanol of the producing strain has been known as one of main hurdles for improving cyanobacterial production system. Thus, to improve cyanobacterial-based 1-butanol production in the future, we employed the metabolomics approach to study the intrinsic effect of improved 1-butanol productivity in DC11. This study focused on metabolite profiling of DC11 using LC/MS/MS. Results showed that there is an accumulation of disaccharide-P and sucrose/trehalose in DC11 compared to the DC7. These metabolites were previously reported to have a role in salt and alcohol stress response in cyanobacteria and therefore, DC11 was subjected to 0.2 M of NaCl and 1000 mg/L of 1-butanol for further investigation. DC11 with stress treatment showed a more prominent accumulation of sugars and nucleosides compared to control. The results obtained from this study may be beneficial for future strain improvement strategies in S. elongatus, particularly addressing the metabolic response of this strain upon 1-butanol stress.

Rice (Oryza sativa) is the main food source for more than 3.5 billion people in the world. Global climate change is having a strong negative effect on rice production. One of the climatic factors impacting rice yield is asymmetric warming, i.e., the stronger increase in nighttime as compared to daytime temperatures. Little is known of the metabolic responses of rice to high night temperature (HNT) in the field. Eight rice cultivars with contrasting HNT sensitivity were grown in the field during the wet (WS) and dry season (DS) in the Philippines. Plant height, 1000-grain weight and harvest index were influenced by HNT in both seasons, while total grain yield was only consistently reduced in the WS. Metabolite composition was analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). HNT effects were more pronounced in panicles than in flag leaves. A decreased abundance of sugar phosphates and sucrose, and a higher abundance of monosaccharides in panicles indicated impaired glycolysis and higher respiration-driven carbon losses in response to HNT in the WS. Higher amounts of alanine and cyano-alanine in panicles grown in the DS compared to in those grown in the WS point to an improved N-assimilation and more effective detoxification of cyanide, contributing to the smaller impact of HNT on grain yield in the DS.

Metabolic profiling of pre-gestational and gestational diabetes mellitus identifies novel predictors of pre-term delivery	JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Metabolomics; Pregnancy; Gestational diabetes; Type 2 diabetes; Pre-term delivery	RISK; WOMEN; ACID; ASSOCIATION; BIRTH; CARE	Background Pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at increased risks of pre-term labor, hypertension and preeclampsia. In this study, metabolic profiling of blood samples collected from GDM, T2DM and control pregnant women was undertaken to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers in GDM/T2DM and compared to pregnancy outcome. Methods Sixty-seven pregnant women (21 controls, 32 GDM, 14 T2DM) in their second trimester underwent targeted metabolomics of plasma samples using tandem mass spectrometry with the Biocrates MxP(R)Quant 500 Kit. Linear regression models were used to identify the metabolic signature of GDM and T2DM, followed by generalized linear model (GLMNET) and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis to determine best predictors of GDM, T2DM and pre-term labor. Results The gestational age at delivery was 2 weeks earlier in T2DM compared to GDM and controls and correlated negatively with maternal HbA1C and systolic blood pressure and positively with serum albumin. Linear regression models revealed elevated glutamate and branched chain amino acids in GDM + T2DM group compared to controls. Regression models also revealed association of lower levels of triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols containing oleic and linoleic fatty acids with pre-term delivery. A generalized linear model ROC analyses revealed that that glutamate is the best predictors of GDM compared to controls (area under curve; AUC = 0.81). The model also revealed that phosphatidylcholine diacyl C40:2, arachidonic acid, glycochenodeoxycholic acid, and phosphatidylcholine acyl-alkyl C34:3 are the best predictors of GDM + T2DM compared to controls (AUC = 0.90). The model also revealed that the triacylglycerols C17:2/36:4 and C18:1/34:1 are the best predictors of pre-term delivery (<= 37 weeks) (AUC = 0.84). Conclusions This study highlights the metabolite alterations in women in their second trimester with diabetes mellitus and identifies predictive indicators of pre-term delivery. Future studies to confirm these associations in other cohorts and investigate their functional relevance and potential utilization for targeted therapies are warranted.

GENOTYPES; ARABIDOPSIS; METABOLOMICS; ACCUMULATION; ACCLIMATION; HOMEOSTASIS	Rice is susceptible to salt stress at the seedling stage. To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying salt tolerance, the metabolic responses to salt stress were investigated with a metabolite-profiling technique. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to profile metabolite changes in five rice lines with a similar genetic background, but with obviously diverse growth performances under saline conditions. A total of 84 metabolites were detected in rice leaf extracts under control and saline conditions. The data revealed that amino acids were enriched more in three salt-tolerant lines (G58, G1710, and IR64) than in two salt-sensitive lines (G45 and G52) under control conditions, suggesting that there were basal metabolite differences between the tolerant and sensitive lines. Additionally, significantly higher allantoin levels in G58, G1710, and IR64 under both stress and control conditions were observed, implying allantoin was important for the better growth of the three rice lines. Moreover, sorbitol, melezitose, and pipecolic acid levels increased considerably in response to salt stress in the five lines, indicating they contribute to rice responses to salt stress significantly. Interestingly, the similar metabolic patterns were regulated by salt stress in the salt-sensitive and salt-tolerant lines, and the main difference was quantitative. The sensitive lines had more pronounced increases during the early stages of the stress treatment than the tolerant lines. Thus, monitoring the metabolome changes of plants may provide crucial insights into how plants tolerate stress. The results presented herein provide valuable information for further elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying rice salt tolerance.

This study aims to provide data for the development of liver function recovery after liver transplantation by dynamically analyzing metabolites of bile acids pathway in serum. Material/Methods: A comprehensive metabolomics profiling of serum of 9 liver transplantation patients before transplantation, on the 1st, 3rd, and 7th days after liver transplantation, and healthy individuals were performed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). Multivariate data and dynamic analysis were used to search for biomarkers between the metabolomics profiles present in perioperative liver transplantation and normal controls. Results: Thirty-three differential endogenous metabolites were screened by the threshold of variable importance in the projection (VIP) from an orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) greater than 1.0, q-value <0.05, and fold change (FC) <= 0.8 or >= 1.2 between the preoperative group and the normal controls in negative mode. The metabolite intensities of taurocholic acid, taurochenodeoxycholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid glycine conjugate, and glycocholic acid pre-transplantation were significantly higher than those of normal controls. The average metabolite intensities of taurocholic acid and taurochenodesoxycholic acid on the first day after liver transplantation were lower than those observed pre-transplantation. The average metabolite intensities on day 3 after liver transplantation showed a sudden increase and then decreased after 7 postoperative days. The average metabolite intensities of glycocholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid glycine conjugate showed an increasing trend on the 1C, 3rd, and 7th days after liver transplantation. Conclusions: Use of taurocholic acid and taurochenodeoxycholic acid-related bile secretion, liver regeneration, and de novo bile acid synthesis may help clinical evaluation and provide data for the development of liver function recovery after liver transplantation.

Analyzing the expression levels of targeted genes and employing both targeted and non-targeted metabolomic approaches, this study investigated the effect of a sudden salt increase on the physiological and metabolic responses of two toxic M. aeruginosa strains separately isolated from fresh and brackish waters, respectively, PCC 7820 and 7806. Supported by differences in gene expressions and metabolic profiles, salt tolerance was found to be strain specific. An increase in salinity decreased the growth of M. aeruginosa with a lesser impact on the brackish strain. The production of intracellular microcystin variants in response to salt stress correlated well to the growth rate for both strains. Furthermore, the release of microcystins into the surrounding medium only occurred at the highest salinity treatment when cell lysis occurred. This study suggests that the physiological responses of M. aeruginosa involve the accumulation of common metabolites but that the intraspecific salt tolerance is based on the accumulation of specific metabolites. While one of these was determined to be sucrose, many others remain to be identified. Taken together, these results provide evidence that M. aeruginosa is relatively salt tolerant in the mesohaline zone and microcystin (MC) release only occurs when the capacity of the cells to deal with salt increase is exceeded.

In this study, the metabolic profiling of two tea cultivars ("Yulv" and "Maotouzhong") in response to different shading periods during the summer season was performed using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The metabolic pathway analyses showed that the glycolytic pathway and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) in the leaves and shoots of "Maotouzhong" were significantly inhibited by long-term shading. The nitrogen metabolism in the leaves of the two cultivars was promoted by short-term shading, while it was inhibited by long-term shading. However, the nitrogen metabolism in the shoots of the two cultivars was always inhibited by shading, whether for short or long-term periods. In addition, the intensity of the flavonoid metabolism in both tea cultivars could be reduced by shading. These results revealed that shading could regulate the carbon and nitrogen metabolism and short-term shading could improve the tea quality to some extent.

Metabolomic profiling of goslings with visceral gout reveals a distinct metabolic signature	BRITISH POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						Goslings; metabolic disorders; serum metabolomics; untargeted GC-TOF-MS analysis; visceral gout	CHROMATOGRAPHY; CORTISOL; CALCIUM; SERUM	1.The objective of the experiment was to analyse serum profiles of goslings with visceral gout and compare them with those of healthy individuals to identify differentially-abundant metabolites as potential biomarkers. 2.Untargeted gas chromatography and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) metabolomic pro?ling was used to compare the serum metabolome of 15 goslings (Anser cygnoides) with gout and 15 healthy goslings (control). 3.Goslings with gout had a metabolic pro?le distinct from that of the controls, with 45 metabolite levels differing significantly (VIP > 1; P < 0.05) between both groups. Nine metabolites (hydrocortisone, glucose, trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline, galactose, 2-deoxy-D-galactose, beta-mannosylglycerate, d-glucoheptose, zymosterol, and hypoxanthine) were selected through receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis (area under curve (AUC) score >= 0.85) as potential biomarkers. Pathway analysis revealed that metabolites with differing levels were mainly involved in galactose, arginine and proline and purine metabolisms. 4.These results provided new insights into the pathogenesis of gout. Increased xanthine and hypoxanthine with decreased hydrocortisone provide promising biomarkers for gosling gout diagnosis. The findings suggested that hepatic metabolic disorders frequently occur in the development of avian gout.

In the present study, we investigated the global metabolite variation in the leaves of 48 accessions of the leafy vegetable Gynandropsis gynandra using two complementary analytical platforms: liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) for an untargeted comparison of non-volatile semi-polar metabolites and gas-chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for an untargeted comparison of volatile metabolites. Our results revealed large variation in 936 semi-polar compounds including flavonoids, terpene glycosides, glucosinolates and various phenolic compounds. Unsupervised multivariate analysis indicated the variation in levels of the semi-polar metabolites was mainly driven by geography, with accessions from both West Africa and Asia forming a group clearly separated from East African accessions. Detected volatile metabolites included various sesquiterpenes, aldehydes, ketones, and sulphur-containing isothiocyanates. Variation in these compounds was however not geographically specific, but most likely linked to the taste and aroma of the leaves. The relative abundance in glucosinolates and isothiocyanates in the leaves allowed the clustering of accessions into two main groups that could be used for further plant-herbivore interaction studies. This study revealed both the broad spectrum of phytochemicals present in Gynandropsis gynandra leaves and the substantial variation in metabolite profiles among accessions from different regions of the world. Our results provide a basis for the development of breeding programs aiming at improving the levels of specialised metabolites in this tropical leafy vegetable for increased resistance against pests and diseases and improved human health.

In this study, the profiles of metabolites produced by wheat seedlings in response to drought stress were investigated using an untargeted approach with ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) to determine various physiological processes related to drought tolerance from the cross between drought-tolerant genotype (HX10) and drought-sensitive genotype (YN211). The current study results showed that under drought stress, HX10 exhibited higher growth indices than YN211. After drought stress treatment, a series of phenolics accumulated higher in HX10 than in YN211, whereas the amount of thymine, a pyrimidine, is almost 13 folds of that in YN211. These metabolites, as well as high levels of different amino acids, alkaloids, organic acids, and flavonoids in the drought treated HX10 could help to explain its strong drought-tolerant capacity. The current study explored the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the drought response of wheat seedling; these metabolome data could also be used for potential QTL or GWAS studies to identify locus (loci) or gene(s) associated with these metabolic traits for the crop improvement.

Such wide-scale ocean deoxygenation affects the distribution of biological communities, impacts the physiology of organisms that may affect their capacity to absorb and process contaminants. Therefore, the bioaccumulation efficiencies of three contrasting radionuclides, nom Ag 134c s and 65Zn were investigated using controlled aquaria in the blue mussel Mytilus edulis under three contrasting dissolved oxygen regimes: normoxic; 7.14 mg L-1, reduced oxygen; 3.57 mg L-1 and hypoxic 1.78 mg L-1 conditions. Results indicated that hypoxic conditions diminished Ag-110m uptake in the mussel, whereas depuration rates were not affected. Similarly, hypoxia appeared to cause a decrease in the Zn-65 bioaccumulation rate, as evidenced by both weakened uptake and rapid elimination rates. Effects of hypoxia on the metabolome of mussels were also explored by untargeted Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopic methods. The metabolic response was characterised by significantly greater abundance of several amino acids, amino sulfonic acids, dicarboxylic acids, carbohydrates and other metabolites in the lowest oxygen treatment, as compared to the higher oxygen treatments. Clearance rates significantly dropped in hypoxic conditions compared to normoxia. Results suggest that hypoxic conditions, and even partly moderate hypoxia, alter ventilation, an-aerobic, oxidative and osmoregulation metabolism of this mussel, which may further influence the trace element bioaccumulation capacity.

Studies have shown significant structural changes in the placentas of women with CVD and several markers of tissue damage have been also described. Patients and Methods: To try to understand the different placental pathologies, research efforts have focused on examining metabolomic profiles as indicators of the repercussions of these vascular disorders. This study examines changes produced in the metabolomic profiles of chorionic villi in the placentas of women with CVD. In a study population of 12 pregnant women, 6 with and 6 without CVD, we compared through mass spectroscopy coupled to ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC-MS), 240 metabolites in chorionic villus samples. Results: This study is the first to detect in the placental villi of pregnant women with CVD, modifications in lysophosphatidylcholines and amino acids along with diminished levels of other lipids such as triglycerides, sphingomyelins, and non-esterified omega 9 fatty acids, suggesting a role of these abnormalities in the pathogenesis of CVD. Conclusions: Our findings are a starting point for future studies designed to examine the impacts of CVD on maternal and fetal well-being.

Ribociclib (RIBO), an orally active Cyclin dependent kinases inhibitor recently approved by USFDA for its clinical efficacy against human epithelial growth factor receptor negative and hormonal receptor positive advanced breast cancer. Although an in vitro metabolite identification study of RIBO is available in literature, no systematic metabolic investigation including detailed structural characterization and toxicity prediction of the metabolites generated in in vivo system is reported till date. Therefore, in this study, we focused on the characterization of its entire metabolites generated in in vitro as well as in vivo matrices. In vitro study includes incubation of RIBO in rat and human liver microsomes and human S9 fraction, while in vivo study was carried out using plasma, urine and faeces samples of male Sprague Dawley rats. A total of 22 metabolites were successfully separated on Agilent SB C18 (100 x 4.6 mm, 2.7 mu) column using ammonium formate (pH 3.5) and acetonitrile as mobile phase. Metabolites were identified with the help of UHPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS by accurate mass measurement. RIBO was found to be metabolised by N- deal-kylation, sulphation, acetylation, oxidation, hydroxylation, carbonylation, dehydrogenation and by a combination of these reactions. The in silico toxicity profiling of all the metabolites was carried out with the help of ProTox-II software. Ten out of twenty two newly identified metabolites showed to have potential for possessing immunotoxicity. Novelty of this investigation can be justified by the unavailability of any previously published literature on complete in vitro and in vivo metabolite profiling of RIBO. Moreover, in silico toxicity of the metabolites were also not known till date.

Data obtained by MS are often zero-inflated. Those zero values are called point mass values (PMVs). Zero values can be further grouped into biological PMVs and technical PMVs. The former type is caused by true absence of a compound and the later type is caused by a technical detection limit. Methods based on a mixture model have been developed to separate the two types of zeros and to perform differential abundance analysis comparing proteomic/metabolomic profiles between different groups of subjects. However, we notice that those methods may give unstable estimate of the model variance, and thus lead to false positive and false negative results when the number of non-zero values is small. In this paper, we propose a new differential abundance analysis method, DASEV, which uses an empirical Bayes shrinkage method to more robustly estimate the variance and enhance the accuracy of differential abundance analysis. Simulation studies and real data analysis show that DASEV substantially improves parameter estimation of the mixture model and outperforms current methods in identifying differentially abundant features.

The same could be true with the dog (Canis lupus familiaris), an important animal model of human disease, but its saliva metabolome is unknown. As a non-invasive sample, canine saliva could offer a new alternative material for research to reveal molecular mechanisms of different (patho)physiological stages, and for veterinary medicine to monitor dogs' health trajectories. Objectives To investigate and characterize the metabolite composition of dog and human saliva in a non-targeted manner. Methods Stimulated saliva was collected from 13 privately-owned dogs and from 14 human individuals. We used a non-targeted ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-qTOF-MS) method to measure metabolite profiles from saliva samples. Results We identified and classified a total of 211 endogenous and exogenous salivary metabolites. The compounds included amino acids, amino acid derivatives, biogenic amines, nucleic acid subunits, lipids, organic acids, small peptides as well as other metabolites, like metabolic waste molecules and other chemicals. Our results reveal a distinct metabolite profile of dog and human saliva as 25 lipid compounds were identified only in canine saliva and eight dipeptides only in human saliva. In addition, we observed large variation in ion abundance within and between the identified saliva metabolites in dog and human. Conclusion The results suggest that non-targeted metabolomics approach utilizing UHPLC-qTOF-MS can detect a wide range of small compounds in dog and human saliva with partially overlapping metabolite composition. The identified metabolites indicate that canine saliva is potentially a versatile material for the discovery of biomarkers for dog welfare. However, this profile is not complete, and dog saliva needs to be investigated in the future with other analytical platforms to characterize the whole canine saliva metabolome. Furthermore, the detailed comparison of human and dog saliva composition needs to be conducted with harmonized study design.

Global metabolomics analysis of serum from humans at risk of thrombotic stroke	ANALYST			English	Article							N-ACETYL-SEROTONIN; OXIDATIVE STRESS; AMINO-ACIDS; METABOLITES; ACTIVATION; RELEASE; HOMOCYSTEINE; MECHANISMS; PREVENTION; APOPTOSIS	We aimed to determine the serum concentrations of altered compounds to understand the changes in metabolism and pathophysiology that occur prior to thrombotic stroke. In this prospective cohort study, high-resolution metabolomics (HRM) was employed to analyze serum samples obtained from patients at risk of stroke (n = 99) and non-risk controls (n = 301). Partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), along with univariate analysis using a false discovery rate (FDR) of q = 0.05 were employed to identify the discriminant metabolic profiles and to determine significantly different metabolites between healthy control and stroke risk groups. PLS-DA satisfactorily separated the stroke risk sera from control sera. Additionally, these discriminant metabolic profiles were not related to hypertension, smoking, diabetes mellitus, or insulin sensitivity. A group of 35 metabolites, most of them amino acids, that were capable of discriminating stroke risk sera from controls were identified using untargeted metabolomics. Further, the targeted metabolomics approach confirmed that the quantified concentrations of l-tryptophan, 3-methoxytyramine, methionine, homocysteinesulfinic acid, cysteine, isoleucine, carnitine, arginine, linoleic acid, and sphingosine were specifically elevated in the sera of patients who were later diagnosed with stroke. Our untargeted and targeted metabolomics approaches support investigating these compounds as novel biomarkers for early and non-invasive detection of thrombotic stroke.

A Novel Serum Metabolomic Profile for the Differential Diagnosis of Distal Cholangiocarcinoma and Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma	CANCERS			English	Article						biliary cancer; differential diagnosis; metabolites; pancreatic cancer; tumor non-invasive biomarker	BIOMARKERS; SIGNATURES; DISEASE	The diagnosis of adenocarcinomas located in the pancreas head, i.e., distal cholangiocarcinoma (dCCA) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), constitutes a clinical challenge because they share many symptoms, are not easily distinguishable using imaging techniques and accurate biomarkers are not available. Searching for biomarkers with potential usefulness in the differential diagnosis of these tumors, we have determined serum metabolomic profiles in healthy controls and patients with dCCA, PDAC or benign pancreatic diseases (BPD). Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) analysis was performed in serum samples from dCCA (n= 34), PDAC (n= 38), BPD (n= 42) and control (n= 25) individuals, divided into discovery and validation cohorts. This approach permitted 484 metabolites to be determined, mainly lipids and amino acids. The analysis of the results led to the proposal of a logistic regression model able to discriminate patients with dCCA and PDAC (AUC value of 0.888) based on the combination of serum levels of nine metabolites (acylcarnitine AC(16:0), ceramide Cer(d18:1/24:0), phosphatidylcholines PC(20:0/0:0) and PC(O-16:0/20:3), lysophosphatidylcholines PC(20:0/0:0) and PC(0:0/20:0), lysophosphatidylethanolamine PE(P-18:2/0:0), and sphingomyelins SM(d18:2/22:0) and SM(d18:2/23:0)) and CA 19-9. In conclusion, we propose a novel specific panel of serum metabolites that can help in the differential diagnosis of dCCA and PDAC. Further validation of their clinical usefulness in prospective studies is required.	[Macias, Rocio I. R.; Sanchez-Martin, Anabel; Marin, Jose J.

Phytochemical and biological characterization of Italian "sedano bianco di Sperlonga" Protected Geographical Indication celery ecotype: A multimethodological approach	FOOD CHEMISTRY			English	Article						White celery; NMR metabolic profiling; FT-ICR mass spectrometry; HPLC; Biogenic amines; Mycotoxins; Biological activity	APIUM-GRAVEOLENS; QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; L.; LEAVES; ANTIOXIDANT; APIACEAE; EXTRACT; PROFILE	Celery is a widely used vegetable known for its peculiar sensorial and nutritional properties. Here, the white celery (Apium graveolens L.) "sedano bianco di Sperlonga" PGI ecotype was investigated to obtain the metabolic profile of its edible parts (blade leaves and petioles) also related to quality, freshness and biological properties. A multi-methodological approach, including NMR, MS, HPLC-PDA, GC-MS and spectrophotometric analyses, was proposed to analyse celery extracts. Sugars, polyalcohols, amino acids, organic acids, phenols, sterols, fatty acids, phthalides, chlorophylls, tannins and flavonoids were detected in different concentrations in blade leaf and petiole extracts, indicating celery parts as nutraceutical sources. The presence of some phenols in celery extracts was here reported for the first time. Low contents of biogenic amines and mycotoxins confirmed celery quality and freshness. Regarding the biological properties, ethanolic celery extracts inhibited the oxidative-mediated DNA damage induced by tert-butylhydroperoxide and scavenged DPPH and ABTS radicals.

Metabolomic networks and pathways associated with feed efficiency and related-traits in Duroc and Landrace pigs	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							MEAT QUALITY TRAITS; GENETIC-PARAMETERS; CANDIDATE GENES; CARCASS MERIT; GROWING PIGS; SELECTION; STRESS; GROWTH; MICROBIOTA	Improving feed efficiency (FE) is a major goal of pig breeding, reducing production costs and providing sustainability to the pig industry. Reliable predictors for FE could assist pig producers. We carried out untargeted blood metabolite profiling in uncastrated males from Danbred Duroc (n = 59) and Danbred Landrace (n = 50) pigs at the beginning and end of a FE testing phase to identify biomarkers and biological processes underlying FE and related traits. By applying linear modeling and clustering analyses coupled with WGCNA framework, we identified 102 and 73 relevant metabolites in Duroc and Landrace based on two sampling time points. Among them, choline and pyridoxamine were hub metabolites in Duroc in early testing phase, while, acetoacetate, cholesterol sulfate, xanthine, and deoxyuridine were identified in the end of testing. In Landrace, cholesterol sulfate, thiamine, L-methionine, chenodeoxycholate were identified at early testing phase, while, D-glutamate, pyridoxamine, deoxycytidine, and L-2-aminoadipate were found at the end of testing. Validation of these results in larger populations could establish FE prediction using metabolomics biomarkers. We conclude that it is possible to identify a link between blood metabolite profiles and FE. These results could lead to improved nutrient utilization, reduced production costs, and increased FE.

Biomarkers can provide an insight into the novel mechanism for MetS and can be potentially used for personalized response to therapies. We exploited a targeted HPLC-MS/MS method to characterize plasma amino acids and carnitine metabolic profile in MetS patients. A training set (40 cases and 40 controls) and validation set (80 MetS patients and 80 healthy controls) were carried out to find the metabolic profiles. We discovered two carnitine metabolites including hydroxydecanoyl carnitine and methylglutarylcarnitine. Our results indicated that the decreased level of hydroxydecanoyl carnitine and methylglutarylcarnitine may be associated with the risk of MetS. These biomarkers may improve the risk prediction and provide a novel tool for monitoring of the progression of disease and response to treatment in MetS patients.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether different levels of SED-time could impact on biochemical and physiological processes occurring in sedentary and physically inactive T2DM patients. In particular, patients from the "Italian Diabetes and Exercise Study (IDES)_2 trial belonging to the first and fourth quartile of SED-time were compared. Urine samples were analyzed by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC x GC) with parallel detection by mass spectrometry and flame ionization detection (GC x 2GC-MS/FID). This platform enables accurate profiling and fingerprinting of urinary metabolites while maximizing the overall information capacity, quantitation reliability, and response linearity. Moreover, using advanced pattern recognition, the fingerprinting process was extended to untargeted and targeted features, revealing diagnostic urinary fingerprints between groups. Quantitative metabolomics was then applied to analytes of relevance for robust comparisons. Increased levels of glycine, L-valine, L-threonine, L-phenylalanine, L-leucine, L-alanine, succinic acid, 2-ketoglutaric acid, xylitol, and ribitol were revealed in samples from less sedentary women. In conclusion, SED-time is associated with changes in urine metabolome signatures. These preliminary results suggest that reducing SED-time could be a strategy to improve the health status of a large proportion of diabetic patients.

By preparing metabolite profiles in biological specimens, we are able to understand pathophysiological mechanisms at the biochemical and thus the functional level. An innovative investigative method, which has not yet been used widely in the forensic context, is to use the clinical application of metabolomics. In a metabolomic analysis of 41 samples of postmortem cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples divided into cohorts of four different causes of death, namely, cardiovascular fatalities, isoIated torso trauma, traumatic brain injury, and multi-organ failure, we were able to identify relevant differences in the metabolite profile between these individual groups. According to this preliminary assessment, we assume that information on biochemical processes is not gained by differences in the concentration of individual metabolites in CSF, but by a combination of differently distributed metabolites forming the perspective of a new generation of biomarkers for diagnosing (fatal) TBI and associated neuropathological changes in the CNS using CSF samples.

Black shank, caused byPhytophthora nicotianae, is a destructive soil-borne disease in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacumL.). The aim of the present study was to investigate the activity and composition of the root exudates from resistant and susceptible tobacco cultivars. The root exudates of the resistant cultivar Gexin 3 showed inhibitory activity againstP. nicotianae, while the exudates of susceptible cultivar Xiaohuangjin 1025 stimulated the colony growth but had no effect on spore germination. Metabolic profiling using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry depicted differing metabolic patterns of root exudates between Gexin 3 and Xiaohuangjin 1025. The activity and composition of root exudates was altered byP. nicotianaeinoculation. Multivariate analysis showed that root exudates (including organic acids, alkaloids, fatty acids, and esters) were different between the two varieties. The defense substances in root exudates, such as tartaric acid, ferulic acid, and lauric acid, may represent a pre-infection prevention strategy for tobacco. Phenylpropanoids as well as inducers of salicylic acid, fatty acids, 6-hydroxyhexanoic acid, and hydrojasmonate may be involved in tobacco defense responses. Compared to the susceptible cultivar, the roots of the resistant cultivar exhibited high enzyme activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase and 4-coumarate-CoA ligase, which may prompt the synthesis and secretion of phenylpropanoids. Our results indicated that the root exudates not only provide a pre-infection prevention strategy by exuding antimicrobial substances, but also increase tobacco disease resistance by eliciting plant defense responses. In addition, some defense compounds as well as compounds that play a role in inducing plant defense responses, showed potential for disease control application. This study provides an insight into possible disease resistance mechanisms of root exudates, and attempts the beneficial utilization of these secondary metabolites of plants.

The underlying mechanisms of the antidiabetic activity have not been fully explored yet. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the alpha-glucosidase inhibitory potential of the hydromethanolic extracts of T. scandens leaves and to characterize the metabolites responsible for such activity through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomics. Crude hydromethanolic extracts of different strengths were prepared and in vitro assayed for alpha-glucosidase inhibition. GC-MS analysis was further carried out and the mass spectral data were correlated to the corresponding alpha-glucosidase inhibitory IC50 values via an orthogonal partial least squares (OPLS) model. The 100%, 80%, 60% and 40% methanol extracts displayed potent alpha-glucosidase inhibitory potentials. Moreover, the established model identified 16 metabolites to be responsible for the alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity of T. scandens. The putative alpha-glucosidase inhibitory metabolites showed moderate to high affinities (binding energies of -5.9 to -9.8 kcal/mol) upon docking into the active site of Saccharomyces cerevisiae isomaltase. To sum up, an OPLS model was developed as a rapid method to characterize the alpha-glucosidase inhibitory metabolites existing in the hydromethanolic extracts of T. scandens leaves based on GC-MS metabolite profiling.

The protective effect of losartan against sorafenib induced cardiotoxicity: Ex-vivo isolated heart and metabolites profiling studies in rat	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Losartan; Sorafenib; Metabolomics; Isolated heart; Cardiotoxicity	OXIDATIVE STRESS; RENAL INJURY; AMINO-ACIDS; INHIBITORS; MODEL; HYPERTENSION; APOPTOSIS; PLASMA	Sorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is used in the treatment of hepatocellular and renal cell carcinoma, was reported to induce cardiotoxicity. This study aimed to investigate the potential cardioprotective effect of losartan against sorafenib-induced cardiotoxicity in rat. Sorafenib significantly reduced the left ventricular pressure, heart rate dp/dt max & dp/dt min (indexes of myocardial contractility and relaxation; respectively), and prolonged both the systolic and diastolic periods. Coadminstration of losartan significantly reversed the effects of sorafenib on heart rate, dp/dt max and dp/dt min. In addition, there was a tendency for losartan to reverse sorafenib reduction in left ventricular pressure and perfusion pressure but it did not reach statistical significance. A GC-MS non-targeted based metabolites profiling of rat plasma revealed elevated metaboites, including urea and fatty acids levels, associated with sorafenib induced cardiotoxicity. However, only glycine and lactic acid were statistically significant. Interestingly, losartan co-administration with sorafenib restored these changes, and resulted in a significantly reduced glycine, urea and some fatty acids levels namely; Cis-vaccenic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid and undecanoic acid. In addition, based on histology results, losartan coadminitration almost obviated sorafenib-induced changes in cardiac tissues. The study suggests that losartan has the potential to exert a protective effect against sorafenib-induced cardiotoxicity.

Berry fruits modulate kidney dysfunction and urine metabolome in Dahl salt-sensitive rats	FREE RADICAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Hypertension; Renal damage; (Poly)phenols; Metabolic alterations; Cysteine catabolism	OIL PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; VARIABLE SELECTION; PLASMA; HYPERTENSION; EXPRESSION; BIOMARKERS; TISSUES; PROTEIN; HEALTH; SERUM	Berries are rich sources of (poly)phenols which have been associated with the prevention of cardiovascular diseases in animal models and in human clinical trials. Recently, a berry enriched diet was reported to decrease blood pressure and attenuate kidney disease progression on Dahl salt-sensitive rats. However, the relationship between kidney function, metabolism and (poly)phenols was not evaluated. We hypothesize that berries promote metabolic alterations concomitantly with an attenuation of the progression of renal disease. For that, kidney and urinary metabolomic changes induced by the berry enriched diet in hypertensive rats (Dahl saltsensitive) were analyzed using liquid chromatography (UPLC-MS/MS) and H-1 NMR techniques. Moreover, physiological and metabolic parameters, and kidney histopathological data were also collected. The severity of the kidney lesions promoted in Dahl rats by a high salt diet was significantly reduced by berries, namely a decrease in sclerotic glomeruli. In addition, was observed a high urinary excretion of metabolites that are indicators of alterations in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, citrate cycle, and pyruvate metabolism in the salt inducedhypertensive rats, a metabolic profile counteracted by berries consumption. We also provide novel insights that relates (poly)phenols consumption with alterations in cysteine redox pools. Cysteine contribute to the redox signaling that is normally disrupted during kidney disease onset and progression. Our findings provide a vision about the metabolic responses of hypertensive rats to a (poly)phenol enriched diet, which may contribute to the understanding of the beneficial effects of (poly)phenols in salt-induced hypertension.

HLB is caused by the supposed bacterial pathogen "Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus" and is transmitted by the insect vector, the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama. Developing new citrus hybrids to improve HLB management is much needed. In this study, we investigated the metabolomic profiles of three new hybrids produced from the cross of C2-5-12 Pummelo (Citrus maxima (L.) Osbeck) x pollen from Citrus latipes. The hybrids were selected based on leaf morphology and seedling vigor. The selected hybrids exhibited compact and upright tree architecture as seen in C. latipes. Hybrids were verified by simple sequence repeat markers, and were subjected to metabolomic analysis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and polar metabolites profiling also showed that the new hybrids were different from their parents. Interestingly, the levels of stored VOCs in hybrid II were higher than those observed in its parents and other hybrids. The level of most VOCs released by hybrid II was also higher than that released from its parents. Additionally, the preference assay showed that hybrid II was more attractive to D. citri than its parents and other hybrids. The leaf morphology, compact and upright architecture of hybrid II, and its attraction to D. citri suggest that it could be used as a windbreak and trap tree for D. citri (double duty), once its tolerance to HLB disease is confirmed. Our results showed that metabolomic analysis could be successfully used to understand the biochemical mechanisms controlling the interaction of D. citri with its host plants.

Plasma samples collected in an early RA randomised strategy study (NCT00920478) that compared clinical (DAS) disease activity assessment with musculoskeletal ultrasound assessment (MSUS) to drive treatment decisions were subjected to untargeted metabolomic analysis. Metabolic profiles were collected at pre- and three months post-commencement of nonbiologic cDMARD. Metabolites that changed in association with changes in the DAS44 score were identified at the three-month timepoint. A total of nine metabolites exhibited a clear correlation with a reduction in DAS44 score following cDMARD commencement, particularly itaconate, its derived anhydride and a derivative of itaconate CoA. Increasing itaconate correlated with improved DAS44 score and decreasing levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). cDMARD treatment effects invoke consistent changes in plasma detectable metabolites, that in turn implicate clinical disease activity with macrophages. Such changes inform RA pathogenesis and reveal for the first time a link between itaconate production and resolution of inflammatory disease in humans. Quantitative metabolic biomarker-based tests of clinical change in state are feasible and should be developed around the itaconate pathway.

Multivariate analysis was conducted to screen for a component that was related to potassium deficiency-induced leaf necrosis among the 60 metabolites detected in tomato leaves. Polyamines, sugars, and branched amino acids were ranked highly. Putrescine was most strongly and negatively correlated with potassium concentration and exhibited an exponential response, regardless of the site or plant body. In addition to putrescine, glucose, xylose and L-isoleucine are known to play important roles in stress response and ion balance control, and it is thought that changes in metabolite profiles are linked to tomato leaf marginal necrosis associated with a decrease in endogenous potassium concentration. These findings will be useful for cultivation management to mitigate this physiological disorder of tomato. (C) 2020, The Society for Biotechnology, Japan. All rights reserved.

(sorrel) were grown in floating system and two consecutive cuts took place: 15 (C1) and 30 (C2) days after sowing. An untargeted metabolomics approach was utilised to fingerprint phenolics and other health-related compounds in sorrel leaves, as well as to unveil differences between the two cuts. The untargeted approach allowed to putatively identify 458 metabolites considering both the cuts. Three new terpenoids and two new phenylpropanoid glycosides (dihydrosyringin and dihydroconiferin) with antifungal and anti-inflammatory activity were annotated. Overall, leaves from C2 had lower level of secondary metabolites (44 were down-accumulated), especially sesquiterpenes and stilbenes. Conversely, anthocyanins showed a relevant increase in C2 than in C1 leaves. The dataset suggests that sorrel leaves represent a good source of nutraceutical compounds and unveils the pivotal effect of pre-harvest factor in secondary metabolite profile.

Studies in animal models indicate that the infection can cause alterations in metabolism of the host, leading to the observed clinical manifestations of the disease. However, there are limited human studies on the impact of schistosome infection on host metabolism, and none describing the changes that occur early in infection. There are also no studies relating to the species Schistosoma haematobium, which causes disease manifested in both the urinary and genital organs. To address this, we analysed the metabolic changes in response to the first S. haematobium infection and treatment in Zimbabwean preschool-aged children. We determined for the first time, that within three months of first infection, there are significant changes in metabolite profiles related to host energy (G6P, 3-PG, AMP, ADP) and purine (AMP, ADP) metabolism. These changes were associated with infection burden and were resolved within three months, following curative treatment. Our findings provide further understanding into the early host metabolic responses to the infection, consistent with clinical manifestations such as malnutrition, poor growth and poor physical and cognitive performance observed in schistosome-infected children. This demonstrates the need for early treatment of the infection, and will inform the development of appropriate interventions such as nutraceuticals in child feeding programs, aimed at reducing disease consequences. Further mechanistic studies will contribute to more understanding of the relationship between metabolic alterations and schistosomiasis in young children. Helminths are parasitic worms that infect over a billion people worldwide. The pathological consequences from infection are due in part, to parasite-induced changes in host metabolic pathways. Here, we analyse the changes in host metabolic profiles, in response to the first Schistosoma haematobium infection and treatment in Zimbabwean children. A cohort of 83 schistosome-negative children (2-5 years old) as determined by parasitological examination, guardian interviews and examination of medical records, was recruited at baseline. Children were followed up after three months for parasitological diagnosis of their first S. haematobium infection, by detection of parasite eggs excreted in urine. Children positive for infection were treated with the antihelminthic drug praziquantel, and treatment efficacy checked three months after treatment. Blood samples were taken at each time point, and capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry in conjunction with multivariate analysis were used to compare the change in serum metabolite profiles in schistosome-infected versus uninfected children. Following baseline at the three-month follow up, 11 children had become infected with S. haematobium (incidence = 13.3%). Our results showed that infection with S. haematobium was associated with significant increases (>2-fold) in discriminatory metabolites, linked primarily with energy (G6P, 3-PG, AMP, ADP) and purine (AMP, ADP) metabolism. These observed changes were commensurate with schistosome infection intensity, and levels of the affected metabolites were reduced following treatment, albeit not significantly. This study demonstrates that early infection with S. haematobium is associated with alterations in host energy and purine metabolism. Taken together, these changes are consistent with parasite-related clinical manifestations of malnutrition, poor growth and poor physical and cognitive performance observed in schistosome-infected children.

Although refined grains are mostly used for fermented foods, the use of whole grains (WGs) in fermented products is gradually gaining prominence due to their benefits. In this study, Lactobacillus fermentum strains were used singly and in combination for the fermentation of WG-ting from WG-sorghum and all possible metabolites profiled using gas chromatography-high resolution time of flight-mass spectrometry. 198 compounds were observed in the experimented samples, classified into different metabolic groups, with varying proportions: esters (23%), ketones (10%), fatty acids methyl esters (7%), and hydrocarbons (6%). Other important metabolites include vitamins, terpenes and terpenoids, phytosterols, phenols, and alcohols. Although similar lactic acid bacteria were used, differences were observed in levels of the metabolites and in some instances, the types of metabolites obtained differ. Much of the differences were attributed to varying fermentation behaviours of the strains, which could be related to their inherent genes. The correlation between metabolites from raw sorghum and the fermented product may assist in developing processing methods to retain the desired metabolites and enhance their functional potentials toward product improvement and for health benefits.

This research field can be used in phytochemical screenings for bioactive species or in the identification of species. Despite its importance in providing a global chemical profile, little research has focused on the optimization of the extraction methods, as each type of matrix requires a specific procedure. Therefore, we propose to evaluate the effect of different extraction features in an ultrasound-assisted extraction for the untargeted metabolomic study of an Ocotea species, a genus of great economical interest but little chemical exploitation. Method optimization was performed in a full factorial 2(2)3(2) design, evaluating the solvent composition, extraction temperature, sample particle size and sample : solvent ratio effects in the metabolomic response. The effect of these parameters on the quality of the untargeted metabolomic profiles was studied by analysis of the extraction yield as well as the chromatographic and spectrometric profiles. Most substances identified were glycosylated flavonoids and aporphinic alkaloids. The application of 70% ethanol enhanced the extraction of several specialized metabolites. Statistical analysis of extraction yield and chemical profiles indicates that high temperatures and low proportion between sample and extracting solvent reduce the quality and modify the chemical profile, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The use of 70% ethanol as the extracting solvent, 1 : 12 sample : solvent ratio, 40 degrees C as the extraction temperature and particle size of 0.595 mm were the optimized conditions to produce a comprehensive chemical profile for Ocotea guianensis.

Leaves	DATA			English	Article; Data Paper						nutrient solution composition; nutrient concentration; macrocations; light intensity; leaf; quality	PLANT METABOLOMICS	The study of the relationship between cultivated plants and environmental factors can provide information ranging from a deeper understanding of the plant biological system to the development of more effective management strategies for improving yield, quality, and sustainability of the produce. In this article, we present a comprehensive metabolomics dataset of two phytochemically divergent lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) butterhead varieties under different growing conditions. Plants were cultivated in hydroponics in a growth chamber with ambient control. The pre-harvest factors that were independently investigated were light intensity (two levels), the ionic strength of the nutrient solutions (three levels), and the molar ratio of three macroelements (K, Mg, and Ca) in the nutrient solution (three levels). We used an untargeted, mass-spectrometry-based approach to characterize the metabolomics profiles of leaves harvested 19 days after transplant. The data revealed the ample impact on both primary and secondary metabolism and its range of variation. Moreover, our dataset is useful for uncovering the complex effects of the genotype, the environmental factor(s), and their interaction, which may deserve further investigation.

Metabolomics may serve as a valuable tool to disentangle the metabolic adaptations and mechanisms that potentially underlie these associations. Objectives To describe the acquisition, processing and structure of the metabolomics data available in a population-based prospective cohort from early pregnancy onwards and to examine the relationships between metabolite profiles of pregnant women and their children at birth and in childhood. Methods In a subset of 994 mothers-child pairs from a prospective population-based cohort study among pregnant women and their children from Rotterdam, the Netherlands, we used LC-MS/MS to determine concentrations of amino acids, non-esterified fatty acids, phospholipids and carnitines in blood serum collected in early pregnancy, at birth (cord blood), and at child's age 10 years. Results Concentrations of diacyl-phosphatidylcholines, acyl-alkyl-phosphatidylcholines, alkyl-lysophosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelines were the highest in early pregnancy, concentrations of amino acids and non-esterified fatty acids were the highest at birth and concentrations of alkyl-lysophosphatidylcholines, free carnitine and acyl-carnitines were the highest at age 10 years. Correlations of individual metabolites between pregnant women and their children at birth and at the age of 10 years were low (range between r = - 0.10 and r = 0.35). Conclusion Our results suggest that unique metabolic profiles are present among pregnant women, newborns and school aged children, with limited intergenerational correlations between metabolite profiles. These data will form a valuable resource to address the early metabolic origins of cardio-metabolic disease.	[Voerman, Ellis; Jaddoe, Vincent W.

Changes in the intestinal environment during early life play a crucial role in modulating the gut microbiota. Therefore, early intervention to change the intestinal environment can be regarded as a new regulation strategy for the growth and health of poultry. However, the effects of intestinal environmental changes on host physiology and metabolism are rarely reported. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of early inoculation with caecal fermentation broth on small intestine morphology, gene expression of tight junction proteins in the ileum, and cecum microbial metabolism of broilers. Results Our data showed that early inoculation with caecal fermentation broth could improve intestine morphology. The small intestine villus height was significantly increased (P < 0.05) in the intervened broilers compared to the control group, especially on day 28. A similar result was observed in the ratio of villus height to crypt depth (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, we found early inoculation significantly increased (P < 0.05) the expression levels of zonula occludens-1 (ZO1) on days 14 and 28, claudin-1 (CLDN1) on day 28, whereas the gene expression of claudin-2 (CLDN2) was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) on days 14 and 28. Gas chromatography time-of-flight/mass spectrometry (GC-TOF/MS) technology was further implemented to systematically evaluate the microbial metabolite profiles. Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) displayed a distinct trend towards separation between the fermentation broth group (F group) and the control group (C group). The differentially expressed metabolites were identified, and they were mainly functionally enriched in beta-alanine metabolism and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. In addition, 1,3-diaminopropane was selected as a key biomarker that responded to early inoculation with caecal fermentation broth. Conclusions These results provide insight into intestinal metabolomics and confirm that early inoculation with caecal fermentation broth can be used as a potential strategy to improve intestinal health of broilers.

Here, in silico metabolism and toxicity prediction of galeon by CYP450, in vitro metabolic profiling study in rat liver microsomes (RLMs), and molecular interactions of galeon-CYP450 isoforms were performed. An in silico metabolic prediction study showed demethyl and mono-hydroxy galeon were the metabolites with the highest predictability. Among the predicted metabolites, mono-hydroxy galeon was found to have plausible toxicities such as skin sensitization, thyroid toxicity, chromosome damage, and carcinogenicity. An in vitro metabolism study of galeon, incubated in RLMs, revealed eighteen Phase-I metabolites, nine methoxylamine, and three glutathione conjugates. Identification of possible metabolites and confirmation of their structures were carried out using ion-trap tandem mass spectrometry. In silico docking analysis of galeon demonstrated significant interactions with active site residues of almost all CYP450 isoforms.	[Rahman, A. F. M.

In the present study we report results of metabolic profiling of RJ samples obtained after the application of artificial bee-feeding using different feeding protocols. The hydrophilic content of RJ samples was assessed by applying (HILIC)UPLC-MS/MS. In total 96 crude RJ samples were analysed with the developed method. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed clear differentiation between the RJ samples obtained from control (non-fed) bees and samples obtained after feeding. In total 27 out of 57 detected molecules were statistically found to be significantly altered in the different comparisons. Among them some amino acids (e.g. tryptophan, lysine), amino acid derivatives (pyroglutamic acid), amines (cadaverine, TMAO, etc.), carbohydrates and vitamins were found as potential markers. The results of the study could be further used for the development of an LC-MS based analytical tool for RJ quality control assessment. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Taohong Siwu decoction (TSD) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, which has been developed to treat AUB for hundreds of years. However, the mechanism of the protective effect of TSD against AUB is not clear. We performed mass spectrometry (MS) of uterine samples to observe metabolic profile resulting from the treatment with TSD. An integrated gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry based untargeted metabolomics approach combined with multivariate statistical analyses were used to investigate the metabolic profile of TSD against AUB. There was clear separation between pregnant and incomplete aborting rats as well as incomplete aborting and TSD administered rats. Based on random forest algorithm and receiver operator characteristic analysis, 12 biomarkers were optimized related to TSD administered. The effect of TSD on AUB are related to several pathways, such as AA metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism. To our knowledge, this is the first uterine metabolomics study focusing on TSD on AUB and provide a new perspective for explaining the mechanism of TSD on AUB.

Metabolomic Profiling of Fungal Pathogens Responsible for Root Rot in American Ginseng	METABOLITES			English	Article						American ginseng; Ilyonectria; root rot; metabolomics; molecular networking; GNPS	MASS-SPECTROMETRY DATA; CYLINDROCARPON-DESTRUCTANS; MOLECULAR NETWORKING; GROWTH	Ginseng root is an economically valuable crop in Canada at high risk of yield loss caused by the pathogenic fungus Ilyonectria mors-panacis, formerly known as Cylindrocarpon destructans. While this pathogen has been well-characterized from morphological and genetic perspectives, little is known about the secondary metabolites it produces and their role in pathogenicity. We used an untargeted tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based approach paired with global natural products social molecular networking (GNPS) to compare the metabolite profiles of virulent and avirulent Ilyonectria strains. The ethyl acetate extracts of 22 I. mors-panacis strains and closely related species were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Principal component analysis of LC-MS features resulted in two distinct groups, which corresponded to virulent and avirulent Ilyonectria strains. Virulent strains produced more types of compounds than the avirulent strains. The previously reported I. mors-panacis antifungal compound radicicol was present. Additionally, a number of related resorcyclic acid lactones (RALs) were putatively identified, namely pochonins and several additional derivatives of radicicol. Pochonins have not been previously reported in Ilyonectria spp. and have documented antimicrobial activity. This research contributes to our understanding of I. mors-panacis natural products and its pathogenic relationship with ginseng.

Altered gut microbiota is implicated in the development of CRC and metabolic perturbations are often associated with changes in the gut microbiome composition. Given the links between gut microbiome and the metabolic profiles in the body, an approach involving ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography combined with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS) metabolomics and 16S rDNA sequencing technology was applied to trace the development UC into CRC in rats. The study identified 11 differential metabolites related to both UC and CRC, which mainly referred to the linoleic acid metabolism. Among these, linoleic acid and 12-hydroxy-8,10-octadecadienoic acid could serve as key biomarkers for the development of UC into CRC. Besides, a significant change was observed in the microflora structure during the development from UC to CRC; this mainly involved a gradual increase in Escherichia-Shigella and a gradual decrease in Lactobacillus. In addition, Pearson's correlation analysis revealed strong correlations between intestinal microflora-related metabolites and specific intestinal microflora, which indicated both of them can promote the transition of UC to CRC. The results of the present study provided positive support for the involvement of intestinal microflora and host metabolism in the pathophysiological mechanism that is responsible for the development of UC into CRC. This information can help understand the risk for CRC that accompanies a diagnosis of UC and also provide different means of targeting these differential metabolites and intestinal microbiota to avoid UC-induced CRC.

Methods 188 plasma metabolites of 30 patients with severe high-gradient aortic valve stenosis (pre-TAVR and 6 weeks post-TAVR) as well as 20 healthy controls (HC) were quantified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Significantly altered metabolites were then correlated to an extensive patient database of clinical parameters at the time of measurement. Results Out of the determined metabolites, 26.6% (n = 50) were significantly altered in patients with AS pre-TAVR compared to HC. In detail, 5/40 acylcarnitines as well as 10/42 amino acids and biogenic amines were mainly increased in AS, whereas 29/90 glycerophospholipids and 6/15 sphingomyelins were mainly reduced. In the post-TAVR group, 10.1% (n = 19) of metabolites showed significant differences when compared to pre-TAVR. Moreover, we found nine metabolites revealing reversible concentration levels. Correlation with clinically important parameters revealed strong correlations between sphingomyelins and cholesterol (r = 0.847), acylcarnitines and brain natriuretic peptide (r = 0.664) and showed correlation of acylcarnitine with an improvement of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (r = - 0.513) and phosphatidylcholines with an improvement of LV mass (r = - 0.637). Conclusion Metabolic profiling identified significant and reversible changes in circulating metabolites of patients with AS. The correlation of circulating metabolites with clinical parameters supports the use of these data to identify novel diagnostic as well as prognostic markers for disease screening, pathophysiological studies as well as patient surveillance.

Takifugu obscurus is an important anadromous fish species of high economic and ecological values. In the present study, T. obscurus was acutely exposed to 44.29 mu g l(-1) 9,10-phenanthrenequione (9,10-PQ) for 96 h. Changes of antioxidant indices and metabolite profiles in plasma were compared between 9,10-PQ treatment and the control. The results showed that 9,10-PQ treatment significantly increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content during 6 to 96 h, increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities at 6 h, but decreased them at 96 h. These results indicated that 9,10-PQ induced oxidative stress to fish. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) analysis revealed that four metabolic pathways were influenced in response to treatment with 9,10-PQ, including glycerophospholipid metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, purine metabolism and sulfur metabolism. These pathways are associated with antioxidant mechanisms, biosynthesis of neurotransmitters and innate immune functions. Thus, the as-obtained results confirmed that 9,10-PQ induced oxidative stress and raised concerns of neurotoxicity and immunotoxicity to fish. Overall, the present study posed a high environmental risk of oxy-PAHs to aquatic ecosystems.

Compared with normal controls, acromegaly patients had elevated levels of 5-aminovaleric acid, glyceric acid, l-dithiothreitol, dihydrocoumarin, N-acetyl-L-glutamic acid, gluconic acid, and monoolein (P < 0.05) and reduced serum levels of d-erythronolactone, taurine, carbamoyl-aspartic acid, and mucic acid (P < 0.01). Furthermore, glyceric acid and taurine possessed higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values (AUC values, 0.914 and 0.931, respectively), suggesting an excellent clinical ability to distinguish acromegaly patients from normal controls. Pathway analysis revealed that the pentose phosphate pathway and the taurine and hypotaurine metabolic pathway are significant pathways (P = 0.002 and 0.004, respectively). Conclusions Metabolic activity is significantly altered in the serum of individuals with active acromegaly. Glyceric acid and taurine may be considered potential biomarkers for distinguishing acromegaly patients from normal controls.

SCs pose a health threat to the individual and to the public due to their central (psychoactive) and peripheral effects. Their pharmacology and toxicology are poorly understood, and the substances can be unexpectedly toxic and harmful. The metabolism of SCs is also relevant in clinical and forensic toxicology as SCs are excreted in urine mostly as their metabolites. Thus, SC metabolites are widely used as markers for identifying SC intake. Herein, we used human liver microsome systems to study the in vitro phase I metabolic profiling of five SCs, namely AM-694, SF-NNEI, FUB-APINACA, MFUBINAC, and AMB-FUBINACA. The metabolites were detected and structurally elucidated by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry. The main metabolic pathway of AM-694 (benzoyl-indole SC) is oxidative defluorination; SF-NNEI (naphthyl-indole carboxamide SC) follows amide hydrolysis and monohydroxylation at the naphthyl moiety. However, indazole carboxamide substituted with an adamantyl group, such as FUB-APINACA, is likely to produce (isomeric) hydroxylation of the adamantyl group as the main metabolite species. For the substrates that contain ester bonds in their structure, like MFUBINAC and AMB-FUBINACA, the ester hydrolysis metabolite is predominant.

They are a source of many bioactive secondary metabolites. Since there are many Egyptian cultivars of fava beans, this study addresses comparative chemical profiling of three Egyptian cultivars of fava beans namely Sakha 3, Nubaria 3, and Giza 843. The study also focuses on the effect of germination on the chemical profile of phenolic compounds and saponins. Sixty-five metabolites were characterized based on their UV spectra, accurate MS, and MS/MS data using RP-HPLC-DAD-ESI-QTOF-MS, including 37 metabolites reported for the first time in fava beans. The observed metabolites are phenolic compounds (flavonoids and phenolic acids), saponins, alkaloids, amino acids, nucleosides, organic acids, sugars, and a jasmonate. In fact, upon quantifying the area of metabolites in their chromatographic profiles, it was remarkable that germination increased the quantities of flavonoids, phenolic acids, and saponins. Moreover, the yield (%) of extracts, TPC, and DPPH increased upon sprouting. The TPC and the relative amounts of flavones, saponins, and amino acids showed a good positive correlation with DPPH. These findings elucidated the first report on the metabolic profiling of these cultivars as well as their antioxidant activities.	[Hassan Mekky, Reham; Thabet, Mareena M.; Elnaggar, Dina M.

The purpose of this work was to find features that differentiate urine metabolic profiles of healthy people and cancer patients. Laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry on gold nanostructures-based techniques were used for the metabolic analysis of urine of 50 patients with kidney cancer. Comparison with data from 50 healthy volunteers led to the discovery of several compounds that may be considered potential renal cell carcinoma (RCC) biomarkers. Statistical analysis of data allowed for the discovery of m/z values that had the greatest impact on group differentiation. A database search enabled the assignment of signals for the most promising 15 features among them: serine, heptanol, 3-methyleneindolenine, 2-methyl-3-hydroxy-5-formylpyridine-4-carboxylate, phosphodimethylethanolamine, 4-methoxyphenylacetic acid, N-acetylglutamine, 3,5-dihydroxyphenylvaleric acid, hydroxyhexanoylglycine, valyl-leucine, leucyl-histidine, oleamide, 9,12,13-trihydroxyoctadecenoic acid, stearidonyl carnitine and squalene. Differences of metabolite profiles of human urine could be identified by gold nanoparticle-enhanced target (AuNPET) LDI MS method and used for the detection of renal cancer.

This study aims to identify serum free fatty acid (FFA) metabolic profiles and screen potential biomarkers for breast cancer diagnosis. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and our in-house fatty acid methyl ester standard substances library were combined to accurately identify FFA profiles in serum samples of breast cancer patients and breast adenosis patients (as controls). Potential biomarkers were screened by applying statistical analysis. A total of 18 FFAs were accurately identified in serum sample. Two groups of patients were correctly discriminated by the orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis model based on FFA profiles. Seven FFA levels were significantly higher in serum from breast cancer patients than that in controls, and exhibited positive correlation with malignant degrees of disease. Furthermore, five candidates (palmitic acid, oleic acid,cis-8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid, docosanoic acid and the ratio of oleic acid to stearic acid) were selected as potential serum biomarkers for differential diagnosis of breast cancer. Our study will help to reveal the metabolic signature of FFAs in breast cancer patients, and provides valuable information for facilitating clinical noninvasive diagnosis.

Saccharomyces cerevisiaeandS. pastorianusspecies and strain differentiation by direct analysis in real time time-of-flight mass spectrometry	RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY			English	Article							DESORPTION IONIZATION-TIME; FATTY-ACID ANALYSIS; SPECIES IDENTIFICATION; REFERENCE-STANDARDS; YEAST PROTEINS; IN-SITU; CLASSIFICATION; METABOLOMICS; GENOME; HERBS	Rationale Seventeen different dried yeast strains, including twelve strains ofSaccharomyces cerevisiaeand five strains ofS. pastorianus, were analyzed using direct analysis in real time (DART) time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The resulting mass spectra were used for rapid species and strain differentiation based upon small-molecule metabolomic profiles. Methods Yeast strains purchased from local shops were suspended in a 1:1 water-methanol solution. Solutions were sampled by dipping the sealed end of a melting point capillary into each vial. Six replicates were measured in positive-ion and negative-ion mode for each strain using an automated linear rail with the DART source operated with helium gas and a gas heater temperature of 350 degrees C. Averaged and centroided mass spectra were exported for analysis with chemometric software. Results Negative-ion DART mass spectra exhibited less chemical background and more distinctive components than positive-ion DART mass spectra. An on-line search of the Yeast Metabolome Database provided candidate metabolites for selection as features for chemometric analysis. Negative-ion DART mass spectra could distinguish both species and all strains. The DART analysis was also able to identify potential metabolomic differences between top-fermenting and bottom-fermenting yeast, between beer and baking yeast, and between red wine and champagne yeast. Conclusions All strains could be distinguished by their negative-ion DART mass spectra with 97.7% validation accuracy. Clear differences were observed between dry and liquid forms andSaccharomycesstrains with different applications to baking or beverage fermentation. Possible differences in metabolite profiles were suggested, but not confirmed, by accurate mass data.

The objectives of this research are to identify putatively the metabolite composition of the stem and the leaves extracts using LC-MS/MS and classify them using PCA. The stem and the leaves samples were separated and extracted using sonication with 70% ethanol. A total of 31 metabolite compounds has been putatively identified. All compounds were identified in the stem and the leaves extracts, which only differed in their intensity. These metabolite compounds were divided into diterpene lactones, flavonoids, and phenolic acid groups. By using the peak intensities of the 18 compounds identified, the leaves and stem extracts were grouped using PCA.

Florets of Carthamus species exhibit various colors, including white, yellow, orange, and red, which are related to their metabolite compositions. We aimed to investigate the metabolites accumulated in florets of three wild (C. lanatus, C. palaestinus, and C. turkestanicus) and one cultivated (C. tinctorius) species of safflower at three developmental stages. Metabolites were extracted from freeze-dried florets using 70% methanol; qualification and quantification were carried out using liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry in positive and negative ion modes followed by extraction of the peaks. Fifty-six metabolites, including phenylpropanoids, chalcones, isoflavonoids, flavanones, flavonols, flavones, and other primary metabolites, were identified for the first time in safflower wild species. The orange florets contained high abundances of safflomin A, anhydrosafflor yellow B, and baimaside, whereas white/cream and light-yellow pigmented florets had high abundances of 1,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, luteolin 7-O-glucuronide, and apigenin 7-O-beta-D-glucuronide. The principal component analysis clearly distinguished the samples based on their pigment types, indicating that color is a dominant factor dictating the identity and amount of the metabolites. Pearson correlation data based on levels of metabolites showed that orange and yellow florets were significantly correlated to each other. White and cream pigmented species were also highly correlated. Comparison between three developmental stages of safflower wild species based on their metabolite profile showed inconsistent. The findings of this study broaden the current knowledge of safflower metabolism. The wide diversity of metabolites in safflower materials also helps in efforts to improve crop quality and agronomic traits.

Al is typically harmful to plants, however Qualea grandiflora Mart., a compulsory accumulator of this metal, may benefit from it. To understand this peculiarity, proteomic and metabolite profiling analyses were carried out to investigate, at physiological, metabolic, and molecular levels, the relevance of Al for this species. Methods Qualea grandiflora plants were grown with MS medium with or without Al-supplementation for 120 days. Metabolite profiling using GC-MS and growth analysis were conducted to evaluate the biochemical and physiological effects of Al. Concomitantly, root proteins were extracted, identified and quantified using label-free LC-MS/MS. Results Al-starved Q. grandiflora plants had shorter shoots, roots, lower biomass, and chlorotic leaves. Furthermore, there was a high coherence between proteomic and metabolomic data. Al was critical for cell wall and lignin syntheses, genetic information processing, and organic acid metabolism. Also, Al might help P uptake in this plant. Conclusions Qualea grandiflora plants needed Al to grow and develop properly. Moreover, there was a good match between the data from physiological/metabolic analyses and the upregulated metabolic pathways indicated by proteome investigation. Hence, we propose that Q. grandiflora root metabolism is highly dependent on Al.	[Cury, Natalia F.; Silva, Renata C. C.; Andre, Michelle S. F.; Silveira, Conceicao E. S.; Williams, Thomas C.

In this study, we treated L. paucicostata with different concentrations (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, or 1 mM) of ethephon. The total dry weight decreased in all ethephon-treated groups compared to the control group. We also investigated the alteration of metabolic profiles induced by ethephon treatment by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. This analysis identified 48 metabolites, and the relative levels of most of alcohols, amino acids, fatty acids, and phenols increased by the ethephon treatment, whereas levels of organic acids and sugars decreased. Among these, the highest production of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA, 5.041 +/- 1.373 mg/L) and ferulic acid (0.640 +/- 0.071 mg/L) was observed in the 0.5 mM and the 0.2 mM ethephon treatment groups, respectively. These results could be useful for large-scale culture of L. paucicostata with enhanced GABA and ferulic acid content for utilization in the food, feed, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries.

Rhizosphere Grown in Contaminated Mine Soil	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							SILICA NANOPARTICLES; NANOMATERIALS; ARABIDOPSIS; TOXICITY; MODULATE; STRESS; ACIDS; SIZE	Silica nanoparticles (SiO2-NPs) are promising in nanoenabled agriculture due to their large surface area and biocompatible properties. Understanding the fundamental interaction between SiO2-NPs and plants is important for their sustainable use. Here, 3 week-old pakchoi (Brassica chinensis L.) plants were sprayed with SiO2-NPs every 3 days for 15 days (5 mg of SiO2-NPs per plant), after which the phenotypes, biochemical properties, and molecular responses of the plants were evaluated. The changes in rhizosphere metabolites were characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomics, and the response of soil microorganisms to the SiO2-NPs were characterized by high-throughput bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene sequencing. The results showed that the SiO2-NP spray had no adverse effects on photosynthesis of pakchoi plants nor on their biomass. However, the rhizosphere metabolite profile was remarkably altered upon foliar exposure to SiO2-NPs. Significant increases in the relative abundance of several metabolites, including sugars and sugar alcohols (1.3-9.3-fold), fatty acids (1.5-18.0-fold), and small organic acids (1.5-66.9-fold), and significant decreases in the amino acid levels (60-100%) indicated the altered carbon and nitrogen pool in the rhizosphere. Although the community structure was unchanged, several bacterial (Rhodobacteraceae and Paenibacillus) and fungal (Chaetomium) genera in the rhizosphere involved in carbon and nitrogen cycles were increased. Our results provide novel insights into the environmental effects of SiO2-NPs and point out that foliar application of NPs can alter the soil metabolite profile.

However, its metabolic profiles have not been revealed. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro metabolism of TUG-891 in hepatocytes. Methods TUG-891 at a concentration of 20 mu M was incubated with rat, dog, and human hepatocytes at 37 degrees C for 120 min. The samples were analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography combined with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The structures of the metabolites were proposed according to their MS/MS product ions. Furthermore, M4 and M5 were biosynthesized using human liver microsomes, and their structures were characterized using C-13-NMR spectroscopy. Results Under the current conditions, eight metabolites were detected and structurally identified using high-resolution LC/MS and MS/MS spectra. The metabolites M4 and M5 were unambiguously confirmed to be TUG-891 alcohol and TUG-891 acid, respectively, using C-13-NMR spectroscopy. Our results revealed that hydroxylation of methyl group at C-21 position to form TUG-891 alcohol (M5) followed by oxidation to yield TUG-891 aldehyde (M7) and carboxylic acid (M4) were the major metabolism processes. Phase II metabolism processes included glucuronidation and sulphation. Conclusions Hydroxylation at the C-21 position was the primary metabolic site of TUG-891. This study provided an overview of the metabolic profiles of TUG-891 in hepatocytes.

Distinct serum metabolomic signatures of multiparous and primiparous dairy cows switched from a moderate to high-grain diet during early lactation	METABOLOMICS			English	Article						Ruminal acidosis; Parity; Dairy cow; Early lactation; Targeted metabolomics	SUBACUTE RUMINAL ACIDOSIS; AMINO-ACID; DIAGNOSTIC MARKERS; BARLEY-GRAIN; RUMEN; MILK; PLASMA; RESPONSES; PROLINE; C26/0-LYSOPHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE	Introduction Feeding of high-grain diets is common in cows during early lactation, but increases the odds of metabolic derailments, which can likely be detected as undesirable shifts in the serum metabolome signature. Objectives The present study aimed to identify the metabolic signatures of the serum metabolome of early lactation dairy cows switched from a moderate to a high-grain diet. Methods Targeted ESI-LC-MS/MS-based metabolomics was used to characterize metabolic alterations in the serum of early lactation multiparous (MP, n = 16) and primiparous (PP, n = 8) Simmental cows, according to parity and feeding phase. Data were analysed using different data mining approaches. Results Carnitine, acetylcarnitine, propionoylcarnitine, amino acid related compounds cis-4-hydroxyproline, trans-4-hydroxyproline, proline betaine, lysophosphatidylcholine PC a C16:1 and phosphatidylcholine PC ae C36:0 were identified as the key metabolites distinguishing MP from PP cows. A different serum metabolite composition during moderate and high-grain diet was also evident. Notably, cows fed high grain diet had higher serum concentrations of primary bile acids and triglycerides, but lower levels of conjugated bile acids and carboxylic acids during the first week in grain. Amino acids valine, cystine and taurine together with lysophosphatidylcholine PC a C26:0 and several phosphatidylcholines were classified as important features for cluster separation. Conclusions Our study greatly expands earlier observations on dietary effects on serum metabolome composition of cows. The altered metabolomic fingerprints clearly distinguishable by diet and cow parity hold potential to be used as early diagnostic tools for cows experiencing grain-induced metabolic disturbances.

As an endocrine disruptor, ATR causes reproductive, immune, nervous system toxicity in biota. In this study, we aimed to investigate metabolic profile characteristics and potential metabolic biomarker that reflects specific damage in toxic effect after ATR exposure. Hence, a metabolomics study was performed to determine the significantly affected metabolites and the reproduction and locomotion of C. elegans were investigated. Mediation analysis was used to evaluate the mediating effect of metabolites on association between ATR exposure and toxic effect. ATR (>= 0.04 mg/L) caused the significant dose dependent reduction of brood size and locomotion behavior, however, the body length and width were significantly decreased only in 40 mg/L group. These results suggesting that brood size, head thrashes and body bends are more sensitive indictor to assessment ATR toxicity in C. elegans. Meanwhile, metabolomics analysis revealed that ATR exposure can induce metabolic profiles significant alterations in C. elegans. We found that 9 metabolites significantly increased and 18 metabolites significantly decreased, such as phosphatidylcholine, GMP, CDP-choline, neopterin etc. Those alteration of metabolites were mainly involved in the pathways: glycerophospholipid metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, folate biosynthesis, glycine, serine and threoninemetabolism, pyrimidine and purine metabolism. Overall, these changes are signs of possible oxidative stress and ATP synthesis disruption modification. Mediation analysis showed a significant indirect effect of ATR exposure on brood size, via 7,8-dihydroneopterin 2',3'-cyclic-p, and phosphatidylcholine might mediate association between ATR exposure and body bends, suggesting that 7,8-dihydroneopterin 2',3'-cyclic-p and phosphatidylcholine might be potentially specificity marker for brood size and body bend respectively. This preliminary analysis investigates metabolic characteristics in C. elegans after ATR exposure, helping to understand the pathways involved in the response to ATR exposure and provide potential biomarkers for the safety evaluation of ATR.

Herein, we performed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based nontargeted metabolomics analysis in 131 patients with their lung tissue pairs to study the metabolic characteristics and disordered metabolic pathways in lung tumor. A total of 339 metabolites were identified in metabolic profiling. Also, 241 differential metabolites were found between lung carcinoma tissues (LCTs) and paired distal noncancerous tissues; amino acids, purine metabolites, fatty acids, phospholipids, and most of lysophospholipids significantly increased in LCTs, while 3-phosphoglyceric acid, phosphoenolpyruvate, 6-phosphogluconate, and citrate decreased. Additionally, pathway enrichment analysis revealed that energy, purine, amino acid, lipid, and glutathione metabolism are markedly disturbed in lung cancer (LCa). Using binary logistic regression, we further defined candidate biomarkers for different subtypes of lung tumor. Xanthine and PC 35:2 were selected as combinational biomarkers for distinguishing benign from malignant lung tumors with a 0.886 area under curve (AUC) value, and creatine, myoinositol and LPE 16:0 were defined as combinational biomarkers for discriminating adenocarcinoma from squamous cell lung carcinoma with a 0.934 AUC value. Overall, metabolic characterization and pathway disturbance demonstrated apparent metabolic reprogramming in LCa. The defined candidate metabolite marker panels are useful for subtyping of lung tumors to assist clinical diagnosis.	[You, Lei; Liu, Xinyu; Noreldeen, Hamada A.

However, this approach still has many limitations; notably, the difficulty of accurately estimating the number of unique metabolites profiled among the thousands of MS ion signals arising from chromatograms. Here, we describe a new workflow, MS-CleanR, based on the MS-DIAL/MS-FINDER suite, which tackles feature degeneracy and improves annotation rates. We show that implementation of MS-CleanR reduces the number of signals by nearly 80% while retaining 95% of unique metabolite features. Moreover, the annotation results from MSFINDER can be ranked according to the database chosen by the user, which enhance identification accuracy. Application of MS-CleanR to the analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana grown in three different conditions fostered class separation resulting from multivariate data analysis and led to annotation of 75% of the final features. The full workflow was applied to metabolomic profiles from three strains of the leguminous plant Medicago truncatula that have different susceptibilities to the oomycete pathogen Aphanomyces euteiches.

Escorial Study Grp	Plasma metabolomic fingerprint of advanced cirrhosis stages among HIV/HCV-coinfected and HCV-monoinfected patients	LIVER INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Child-Turcotte-Pugh; Chronic hepatitis C; cirrhosis; HIV; metabolomics	OXIDATIVE STRESS; HEPATITIS-C; LIVER-CIRRHOSIS; GUT MICROBIOTA; ACID; CARNITINE; RESPONSES; FIBROSIS	Background & Aims Hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cirrhosis induce metabolic disorders. Here, we aimed to evaluate the association of plasma metabolites with Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score and hepatic decompensation in HIV/HCV-coinfected and HCV-monoinfected patients with advanced cirrhosis. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out in 62 HIV/HCV-coinfected and 28 HCV-monoinfected patients. Metabolomics analysis was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The statistical association analysis was performed by partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and generalized linear model (GLM) with binomial distribution (to analyse HIV coinfection, high alcohol intake, treatment with statins, previous HCV therapy failure and decompensation) and ordinal logistic regression (OLR) models to analyse different stages of cirrhosis (CTP score). Results The statistical analysis identified plasma metabolites associated with HIV coinfection, high alcohol intake, CTP score and hepatic decompensation. Overall, fatty acids, bile acids, aromatic and sulphur amino acids, butyrate derivatives, oxidized phospholipids, energy-related metabolites and bacterial fermentation-related metabolites were increased in more advanced cirrhosis stages; while lysophosphatidylcholines and lysophosphatidylethanolamines, branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and metabolites of tricarboxylic acid cycle, among others, were decreased in more advanced cirrhosis. Most of the significant metabolites displayed a similar trend after stratifying for HIV/HCV- and HCV-infected patients. Glycolic acid, LPC (16:0) and taurocholic acid had high accuracy for discriminating patients according to decompensated cirrhosis (CTP >= 7). Conclusion Altered plasma metabolomic profile was associated with advanced stages of cirrhosis in HIV/HCV-coinfected and HCV-monoinfected patients.

Methods Serum levels of caffeine and its 11 downstream metabolites from independent double cohorts consisting of PD (n = 111, 160), PSP (n = 30, 19), MSA (n = 23, 17), and healthy controls (n = 43, 31) were examined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The association of each metabolite with clinical parameters and medication was investigated. Mutations in caffeine-associated genes were investigated by direct sequencing. Results A total of 9 metabolites detected in more than 50% of participants in both cohorts were decreased in 3 parkinsonian disorders compared with healthy controls without any significant association with age at sampling, sex, or disease severity (Hoehn and Yahr stage and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor section) in PD, and levodopa dose or levodopa equivalent dose in PSP and MSA. Of the 9 detected metabolites, 8 in PD, 5 in PSP, and 3 in MSA were significantly decreased in both cohorts even after normalizing to daily caffeine consumption. No significant genetic variations in CYP1A2 or CYP2E1 were detected when compared with controls. Conclusion Serum caffeine metabolic profiles in 3 parkinsonian diseases show a high level of overlap, indicative of a common potential mechanism such as caffeine malabsorption from the small intestine, hypermetabolism, increased clearance of caffeine, and/or reduced caffeine consumption.

However, the absorbed substances of XIAOPI formula and their influences on metabolic pathways are largely remained unknown. Liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry was used to identify the substances existing in the serum. Network pharmacology was utilized to explore the underlying metabolic targets and pathways involved in. Western blotting and immunofluorescence assays were carried out for target validation. The exogenous results demonstrated 196 compounds were filtered as absorbed substances, among which 63 constituents or metabolites were tentatively identified in rat serum, and the metabolites of tanshinone II and tanshinone I were found to act as the major metabolic pathways. Subsequently, the endogenous results revealed that XIAOPI formula could significantly regulate serum biochemical indices and the bile acid secretion signaling ranks as top1 among all the involved pathways. The levels of intermediates including cholic acid, glycocholic acid, taurochenodeoxycholic acid and taurocholic acid were significantly upregulated following XIAOPI treatment, accompanied by increased expression of key enzyme CYP7A1, indicating that XIAOPI formula could accelerate the bile acid metabolism pathway. Our study presented a comprehensive metabolic profile of XIAOPI formula in vivo for the first time, and bile acid synthesis pathway might be one of the key mechanisms contributing to the pharmacological function of the formula.

Finasteride treats MPB by inhibiting 5-alpha reductase and blocking DHT production. In this study, we aimed to identify metabolic differences in urinary metabolomics profiles between MPB patients after a one-year treatment with finasteride and healthy controls. Untargeted and targeted metabolomics profiling was performed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). We hypothesized that there would be changes in overall metabolite concentrations, especially steroids, in the urine of hair loss patients treated with finasteride and normal subjects. Untargeted analysis indicated differences in steroid hormone biosynthesis. Therefore, we conducted targeted profiling for steroid hormone biosynthesis to identify potential biomarkers, especially androgens and estrogens. Our study confirmed the differences in the concentration of urinary androgens and estrogens between healthy controls and MPB patients. Moreover, the effect of finasteride was confirmed by the DHT/T ratio in urine samples of MPB patients. Our metabolomics approach provided insight into the physiological alterations in MPB patients who have been treated with finasteride for a year and provided evidence for the association of finasteride and estrogen levels. Through a targeted approach, our results suggest that urinary estrogens must be studied in relation to MPB and post-finasteride syndrome.

Use of untargeted metabolomics for assessing soil quality and microbial function	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Biomarker; Chemical fingerprinting method; Metabolic profiling; Microbial function; Soil health indicator	COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; PLANT METABOLOMICS; REVEALS; IDENTIFICATION; SPECTROSCOPY; METABOLITES; NMR	Soils support a wide range of ecosystem services that underpin Earth system functioning. It is therefore essential that we have robust approaches to evaluate how anthropogenic perturbation affects soil quality and the delivery of these services. Metabolomics, the large-scale study of low molecular weight organic compounds in soil, offers one potential approach to characterise soils and evaluate the metabolic status of the soil biological community. The aims of the present study were to 1) characterise the soil metabolome across a contrasting range of soil types, 2) understand the relationships between common chemical and physical soil quality indicators and its metabolome, and 3) evaluate the discriminatory power of soil metabolomics and its potential use as a soil quality indicator. Nine different topsoils with 5 replications were collected along an altitudinal primary productivity gradient encompassing a wide range of soil types and land uses. Metabolites were extracted from soil using 3:3:2 (v/v/v) acetonitrile:isopropanol:water and individual compounds identified using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) platform. Overall, 405 individual compounds were detected, of which 146 were positively identified, including sugars, amino acids, organic acids, nucleobases, sugar alcohols, lipids and a range of secondary metabolites. The concentration and profile of metabolites was found to vary greatly between the soil types. Further, the soils' metabolomic fingerprints correlated to a number of environmental factors, including pH, land-use, moisture and salinity. We also tentatively attributed soil-specific metabolites to potential functional pathways, although complementary proteomic, genomic and transcriptomic approaches would be needed to provide definitive supporting evidence. In conclusion, soil metabolomics offers the potential to reveal the complex molecular networks and metabolic pathways operating in the soil microbial community and a means of evaluating soil function. Further work is now required to benchmark soil metabolomes under a wide range of management regimes so that they can be used for the quantitative assessment of soil quality.

The aim of this study was to explore the actinobacterial diversity of the saline lake, situated in the salt range, Punjab, Pakistan and to screen them for antagonistic activities against multi drug resistant pathogens and to characterize the bioactive metabolites produced by them. A total of seventy strains of actinomycetes were isolated from lake samples, out of them only forty bioactive strains were selected for further characterization on the basis of their preliminary antimicrobial activities. The isolated actinobacterial strains showed an optimum growth at alkaline pH (9.0-9.5). The taxonomic analysis revealed that these isolates were closely affiliated with the genus Streptomyces (62.5%), Lentzae (6.25%), Pseudonocardia (6.25%), Lechevalieria (6.25%) and Nocardiopsis (12.5%). Most of the isolated strains exhibited strong inhibition against a broad range of pathogenic test organisms. The partial purification and metabolite profiling using ultra performance liquid chomatography and mass spectrometric (UPLC-MS) analysis suggested the presence of a variety of bioactive compounds including totarol, kifunensine, talaromycin and clausine F. These results indicated that Kallar Kahar Lake harbors a significant diversity of actinobacterial strains which are able to produce a diverse range of biotechnologically and pharmaceutically potent compounds. Further studies related to the structure elucidation of secondary metabolites can lead to the discovery of new and useful drug candidates.

Metabolite profiling was obtained by a ultrahigh resolution liquid chromatography orbitrap MS analysis (UHPLC-ESI-OT-MS-MS). The antioxidant properties were screened by four methods: 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl assay (DPPH), trolox equivalent antioxidant activity assay (TEAC), ferric-reducing antioxidant power assay (FRAP), and lipid peroxidation in erythrocytes (LP)). The antibacterial activity was evaluated according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) rules. The resin displayed a strong DPPH scavenging activity (IC50 = 25.72 mu g/mL) and showed a percentage of inhibition of LP close to that of the reference compound catechin (70% at 100 mu g ZpRe/mL), while a moderated effect was observed in the FRAP and TEAC assays. The resin showed a content of phenolic and flavonoid compounds of 391 mg GAE/g and 313 mg EQ/g respectively. Fifty phenolics compounds were identified by ultrahigh resolution liquid chromatography orbitrap MS analysis (UHPLC-PDA-OT-MS) analysis. Thirty-one compounds are reported for the first time, updating the knowledge on the chemical profile of this species. The importance of the biomolecules identified support traditional use of this endemic plant. Furthermore, additional pharmacological data is presented that increase the potential interest of this plant for industrial sustainable applications.

In Vitro Enzyme Inhibitory Properties, Secondary Metabolite Profiles and Multivariate Analysis of Five Seaweeds	MARINE DRUGS			English	Article						seaweeds; antioxidants; tyrosinase; bioactive metabolites; biological activities	ASPHODELINE-ANATOLICA; ANTIOXIDANT	Seaweeds have been exploited as both food products and therapeutics to manage human ailments for centuries. This study investigated the metabolite profile of five seaweeds (Halimeda spp., Spyridia hypnoides (Bory de Saint-Vincent) Papenfuss, Valoniopsis pachynema (G. Martens) Borgesen, Gracilaria fergusonii J. Agardh and Amphiroa anceps (Lamarck) Decaisne using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS). Furthermore, these seaweeds were assessed for antioxidant and inhibitory effects against alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase, acetyl-cholinesterase (AChE), butyryl-cholinesterase (BChE) and tyrosinase. Valoniopsis pachynema and A. anceps yielded the highest flavonoid (4.30 +/- 0.29 mg RE/g) and phenolic content (7.83 +/- 0.08 mg RE/g), respectively. Additionally, A. anceps exhibited significant antioxidant properties with all assays and significantly depressed BChE (IC50 = 6.68 +/- 0.83 mg/mL) and alpha-amylase activities (IC50 = 5.34 +/- 0.14 mg/mL). Interestingly, the five seaweeds revealed potent inhibitory effects against tyrosinase activity. In conclusion, A. anceps might be considered as a key source of phytoantioxidants and a potential candidate to develop nutritional supplements. Besides, the five tested seaweeds warrant further study and may be exploited as promising natural sources for managing hyperpigmentation.

One of the many factors that influences anestrus is the inactive ovary. To characterize in detail the plasma metabolic profile, anestrus cows suffering from inactive ovaries were compared with those with natural estrus. The Holstein cows 60 to 90 day postpartum in an intensive dairy farm were assigned into inactive ovaries groups (IO, n=20) and natural estrus group (CON. n=22) according to estrus signs and rectal palpation of ovaries. Plasma samples from two groups of cows were collected from the tail vein to screen differential metabolites using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) techniques and multivariate statistical analysis and pathways. The results showed that 106 compounds were screened by GC/MS and 14 compounds in the IO group were decreased by analyzing important variables in the projection values and ip values of MSA.Through pathway analysis. 14 compounds, mainly associated with carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism, were identified to results in IO, which may seriously affect follicular growth. Metabolomics profiling. together with MSA and pathway analysis, showed that follicular growth and development in daily cows is related to carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism by a single or multiple pathway(s).

Herein, we investigate the freeze tolerance of this species and profile changes in liver and skeletal muscle metabolite levels using an untargeted LC-MS-based metabolomic approach to investigate molecular mechanisms that may contribute to freezing survival. We found that three of seven specimens ofN. parkericould survive after being frozen for 12 h at - 2.0 degrees C with 39.91% +/- 5.4% (n = 7) of total body water converted to ice. Freezing exposure induced partial dehydration of the muscle, which contributed to decreasing the amount of freezable water within the muscle and could be protective for the myocytes themselves. A comparative metabolomic analysis showed that freezing elicited significant responses, and a total of 33 and 36 differentially expressed metabolites were identified in the liver and muscle, respectively. These metabolites mainly participate in alanine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, and D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism. After freezing exposure, the contents of ornithine, melezitose, and maltotriose rose significantly; these may act as cryoprotectants. Additionally, the content of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanine, 7-Ketocholesterol and hypoxanthine showed a marked increase, suggesting that freezing induced oxidative stress in the frogs. In summary,N. parkerican tolerate a brief and partial freezing of their body, which was accompanied by substantial changes in metabolomic profiles after freezing exposure.

Confirmation of neurometabolic diagnoses using age-dependent cerebrospinal fluid metabolomic profiles	JOURNAL OF INHERITED METABOLIC DISEASE			English	Article						biomarkers; CSF; mass spectrometry; metabolomics; neurometabolic disorders	CONCENTRATION GRADIENTS; ACID; METABOLITES; CSF	Timely diagnosis is essential for patients with neurometabolic disorders to enable targeted treatment. Next-Generation Metabolic Screening (NGMS) allows for simultaneous screening of multiple diseases and yields a holistic view of disturbed metabolic pathways. We applied this technique to define a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reference metabolome and validated our approach with patients with known neurometabolic disorders. Samples were measured using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry followed by (un)targeted analysis. For the reference metabolome, CSF samples from patients with normal general chemistry results and no neurometabolic diagnosis were selected and grouped based on sex and age (0-2/2-5/5-10/10-15 years). We checked the levels of known biomarkers in CSF from seven patients with five different neurometabolic disorders to confirm the suitability of our method for diagnosis. Untargeted analysis of 87 control CSF samples yielded 8036 features for semiquantitative analysis. No sex differences were found, but 1782 features (22%) were different between age groups (q < 0.05). We identified 206 diagnostic metabolites in targeted analysis. In a subset of 20 high-intensity metabolites and 10 biomarkers, 17 (57%) were age-dependent. For each neurometabolic patient, >= 1 specific biomarker(s) could be identified in CSF, thus confirming the diagnosis. In two cases, age-matching was essential for correct interpretation of the metabolomic profile. In conclusion, NGMS in CSF is a powerful tool in defining a diagnosis for neurometabolic disorders. Using our database with many (age-dependent) features in CSF, our untargeted approach will facilitate biomarker discovery and further understanding of mechanisms of neurometabolic disorders.

Random forest regression analysis and stepwise multiple linear regression were used to identify key metabolic biomarkers related to the freshness of chilled chicken. A total of 265 differential metabolites were identified during storage of chilled chicken. Of these various metabolites, 37 were selected as potential biomarkers by random forest regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated that the biomarkers identified using random forest regression analysis showed a strong correlation with the freshness of chilled chicken. Subsequently, stepwise multiple linear regression analysis based on the biomarkers identified by using random forest regression analysis identified indole-3-carboxaldehyde, uridine monophosphate, s-phenylmercapturic acid, gluconic acid, tyramine, and Serylphenylalanine as key metabolic biomarkers. In conclusion, our study characterized the metabolic profiles of chilled chicken stored for different lengths of time and identified six key metabolic biomarkers related to the freshness of chilled chicken. These findings can contribute to a better understanding of the changes in the metabolic profiles of chilled chicken during storage and provide a basis for the further development of novel detection methods for the freshness of chilled chicken.

We used a multiplatform metabolomics approach to identify metabolite markers and metabolic pathways that distinguish NAFL from early NASH and advanced NASH. We analyzed fasting serum samples from 57 prospectively-recruited patients with histologically-proven NAFLD, including 12 with NAFL, 31 with early NASH and 14 with advanced NASH. Metabolite profiling was performed using a combination of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy analyzed with multivariate statistical and pathway analysis tools. We targeted 237 metabolites of which 158 were quantified. Multivariate analysis uncovered metabolite profile clusters for patients with NAFL, early NASH, and advanced NASH. Also, multiple individual metabolites were associated with histological severity, most notably spermidine which was more than 2-fold lower in advanced fibrosis vs. early fibrosis, in advanced NASH vs. NAFL and in advanced NASH vs. early NASH, suggesting that spermidine exercises a protective effect against development of fibrosing NASH. Furthermore, the results also showed metabolic pathway perturbations between early-NASH and advanced-NASH. In conclusion, using a combination of two reliable analytical platforms (LC-MS and NMR spectroscopy) we identified individual metabolites, metabolite clusters and metabolic pathways that were significantly different between NAFL, early-NASH, and advanced-NASH. These differences provide mechanistic insights as well as potentially important metabolic biomarker candidates that may noninvasively distinguish patients with NAFL, early-NASH, and advanced-NASH. The associations of spermidine levels with less advanced histology merit further assessment of the potential protective effects of spermidine in NAFLD.

To investigate the metabolic profile in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and explore the potential biomarkers to predict prognosis after TAVR based on metabolomics. Methods and Results. Fifty-nine consecutive AS patients were prospectively recruited. Blood samples from the ascending aorta, coronary sinus, and peripheral vein at before and after TAVR were collected, respectively. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were performed to analyze the metabolic profile before and after TAVR. Influential metabolites were identified by integrating the univariate test, multivariate analysis, and weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) algorithm. PLS-DA analysis revealed a significant extremely early (within 30 minutes after TAVR) alterations of metabolites in the ascending aorta, coronary sinus, and peripheral vein. The early (within 7 days after TAVR) changed metabolites in the peripheral vein were involved in purine metabolism, primary bile acid biosynthesis, glycerolipid metabolism, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, one carbon pool by folate and alanine, and the aspartate and glutamate metabolism pathway. We used volcano plots to find that the cardiac-specific changed metabolites were enriched to the sphingolipid metabolism pathway after TAVR. Besides, WGCNA algorithm was performed to reveal that arginine and proline metabolites could reflect left ventricle regression to some extent. Conclusion. This is the first study to reveal systemic and cardiac metabolites changed significantly in patients with AS after TAVR. Some altered metabolites involved in the arginine and proline metabolism pathway in the peripheral vein could predict left ventricle regression, which merited further study.

Metabolic Profiling in Human Fibroblasts Enables Subtype Clustering in Glycogen Storage Disease	FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						inborn error of metabolism; metabolism; metabolomics; mitochondria; glycogen storage disease; energy deficiency; redox homeostasis	DEBRANCHING ENZYME GENE; GLUCOSE-6-PHOSPHATASE GENE; MUTATIONS; LIVER	Glycogen storage disease subtypes I and III (GSD I and GSD III) are monogenic inherited disorders of metabolism that disrupt glycogen metabolism. Unavailability of glucose in GSD I and induction of gluconeogenesis in GSD III modify energy sources and possibly, mitochondrial function. Abnormal mitochondrial structure and function were described in mice with GSD Ia, yet significantly less research is available in human cells and ketotic forms of the disease. We hypothesized that impaired glycogen storage results in distinct metabolic phenotypes in the extra- and intracellular compartments that may contribute to pathogenesis. Herein, we examined mitochondrial organization in live cells by spinning-disk confocal microscopy and profiled extra- and intracellular metabolites by targeted LC-MS/MS in cultured fibroblasts from healthy controls and from patients with GSD Ia, GSD Ib, and GSD III. Results from live imaging revealed that mitochondrial content and network morphology of GSD cells are comparable to that of healthy controls. Likewise, healthy controls and GSD cells exhibited comparable basal oxygen consumption rates. Targeted metabolomics followed by principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering (HC) uncovered metabolically distinct poises of healthy controls and GSD subtypes. Assessment of individual metabolites recapitulated dysfunctional energy production (glycolysis, Krebs cycle, succinate), reduced creatinine export in GSD Ia and GSD III, and reduced antioxidant defense of the cysteine and glutathione systems. Our study serves as proof-of-concept that extra- and intracellular metabolite profiles distinguish glycogen storage disease subtypes from healthy controls. We posit that metabolite profiles provide hints to disease mechanisms as well as to nutritional and pharmacological elements that may optimize current treatment strategies.

Biallelic variants in HPDL, encoding 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase-like protein, lead to an infantile neurodegenerative condition	GENETICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						HPDL; HPD; 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase-like protein; oxidoreductase; neurodegenerative disease	TYROSINEMIA TYPE-III; NEUROMETABOLIC DISORDERS; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; MUTATIONS; GENE; SEQUENCES; ALIGNMENT	Purpose Dioxygenases are oxidoreductase enzymes with roles in metabolic pathways necessary for aerobic life. 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase-like protein (HPDL), encoded by HPDL, is an orphan paralogue of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPD), an iron-dependent dioxygenase involved in tyrosine catabolism. The function and association of HPDL with human diseases remain unknown. Methods We applied exome sequencing in a cohort of over 10,000 individuals with neurodevelopmental diseases. Effects of HPDL loss were investigated in vitro and in vivo, and through mass spectrometry analysis. Evolutionary analysis was performed to investigate the potential functional separation of HPDL from HPD. Results We identified biallelic variants in HPDL in eight families displaying recessive inheritance. Knockout mice closely phenocopied humans and showed evidence of apoptosis in multiple cellular lineages within the cerebral cortex. HPDL is a single-exonic gene that likely arose from a retrotransposition event at the base of the tetrapod lineage, and unlike HPD, HPDL is mitochondria-localized. Metabolic profiling of HPDL mutant cells and mice showed no evidence of altered tyrosine metabolites, but rather notable accumulations in other metabolic pathways. Conclusion The mitochondrial localization, along with its disrupted metabolic profile, suggests HPDL loss in humans links to a unique neurometabolic mitochondrial infantile neurodegenerative condition.

In view of the fact that parasite infection affects host metabolism, and there is an intricate relationship between metabolism and immunity. Metabolic analysis of the spleen could be helpful for understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms in clonorchiasis. A non-targeted ultra high performance liquid tandem chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF MS) approach was employed to investigate the metabolic profiles of spleen in rats at 4 and 8 weeks post infection withClonorchis sinensis(C. sinensis). Then a targeted ultra-high performance liquid chromatography multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MRM-MS/MS) approach was used to further quantify amino acid metabolism. Multivariate data analysis methods, such as principal components analysis and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis, were used to identify differential metabolites. Finally, a total of 396 and 242 significant differential metabolites were identified in ESI+ and ESI- modes, respectively. These metabolites included amino acids, nucleotides, carboxylic acids, lipids and carbohydrates. There were 38 significantly different metabolites shared in the two infected groups compared with the control group through the Venn diagram. The metabolic pathways analysis revealed that pyrimidine metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, purine metabolism and phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis were significantly enriched in differential metabolites, which was speculated to be related to the disease progression of clonorchiasis. Furthermore, 15 amino acids screened using untargeted profiling can be accurately quantified and identifed by targeted metabolomics during clonrochiasis. These results preliminarily revealed the perturbations of spleen metabolism in clonorchiasis.

Mey (ginseng) in the near decades. Our previous study indicated sulfur-fumigation could transform ginsenosides, the active components of ginseng, into sulfur-containing derivatives (SFCDs), the artifacts with unknown toxicity. However, whether the biotransformation could be occurred and absorption characteristics between ginsenosides and SFCDs are still needed to further investigate. Aim of the study: To evaluate the effect of sulfur-fumigation process on ginseng through comparing the metabolic profile and absorption characteristics between ginsenoside Rg1, Re and their SFCDs. Materials and methods: Intestinal microflora and liver S9 fraction were utilized to compare the metabolic profile, and single-pass intestinal perfusion and Caco-2 cell models were applied to compare the absorption characteristics, between Rg1, Re and their SFCDs. Results: Rg1 and Re were metabolized to 7 none sulfur-containing metabolites, while their SFCDs were metabolized to 18 sulfur-containing metabolites. The intestinal absorption and transport of Rg1 and Re were much greater than their SFCDs. Besides, the uptakes of Rg1 and Re were transport-dependent, but their SFCDs were non-transport-dependent. Conclusion: Ginsenosides and their SFCDs could not be bio-transformed with each other and their absorption characteristics were quite different, which suggested that sulfur-fumigation is not a feasible post-harvest process of ginseng.

Our study designed to reveal the potentially pharmacological effects of dioscin on SW480 rectal cancer cells using nontargeted metabolomics method to probe into small molecular metabolites and pathway changes. After the cell assay of proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion, the dioscin-treated cell samples were prepared for nontargeted metabolomics analysis based on LC-MS tool to describe the metabolic profiles. Dioscin has prevented cell proliferation and accelerated cell apoptosis, and it also inhibited the SW480 rectal cancer cells' migration and invasion. A total of 22 metabolites were selected as promising biomarkers of pharmacological reaction of dioscin to rectal cancer, and eight highly correlated pathways including D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, glycolysis or gluconeogenesis, citrate cycle (TCA cycle), and butanoate metabolism were identified. It showed that strategies based on cell metabolomics are helpful tools to discover the small molecular metabolites to elucidate the action mechanism of drug.

We optimized the analytical conditions for nano-flow injection/Q-TOFMS, and set the flow rate and ion source temperature to 1000 nL/min and 150 degrees C, respectively. Under optimal conditions, a single run was finished within 3 min, and the RSD value of 50 sequential injections was 4.2%. The method also showed quantitativity of four stable-isotope-labeled compounds (r(2) > 0.99), demonstrating its robustness, high repeatability, and specificity. In addition, we compared three sample-preparation methods for rodent blood samples and found that protein precipitation with threefold methanol was the most effective. Finally, we applied the method to plasma samples from the serotonin syndrome (SS) model and control rats, the results of which were evaluated by principal component analysis (PCA). The two groups showed clearly separated PCA score plots, suggesting that the method could successfully catch the differences in metabolic profiles between SS and control rats. The results obtained from our new method were further validated by using the established gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method, which demonstrated that there were good correlations between the two methods (R = 0.902 and 0.958 for lactic acid and malic acid, respectively, each at p < 0.001), thus proving the validity of our method. The method described here enables high-throughput analysis of metabolites and will be of use for the rapid analysis of metabolic profiles.

Additionally, gardening intervention as a regular physical activity for the elderly maintained and improved physical, psychology, cognitive, and social health. This study was conducted to determine whether the cognitive ability of the elderly is affected by participating in a gardening activity program as a physical activity with a metabolomic potential biomarker. The gardening program was designed as a low to moderate intensity physical activity for the elderly. Serum metabolites resulting from gardening were subjected to metabolite profiling using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-linear trap quadruple-orbitrap-mass spectrometry followed by multivariate analyses. The partial least squares-discriminant analysis showed distinct clustering patterns among the control, non-gardening, and gardening groups. According to the pathway analysis, tryptophan metabolism including tryptophan, kynurenine, and serotonin showed significantly distinctive metabolites in the gardening group. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels (BDNF) in the gardening group were significantly increased after the gardening program. Correlation map analysis showed that the relative levels of tryptophan metabolites were positively correlated with BDNF. Our results show that tryptophan, kynurenine, and serotonin may be useful as metabolic biomarkers for improved cognitive ability by the gardening intervention.

WALP; ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY; PHENOLIC COMPOSITION; BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS; PROTEIN; PEPTIDES; OLIGOSACCHARIDES; DIGESTIBILITY; HYDROLYSIS	Asparagus bean immature pods and seeds are popular as food products for healthy and functional nutrition. Gas chromatography with mass spectrometry was used to compare metabolomic profiles of seeds and pods yielded by old Chinese landraces and the modern cultivars 'Yunanskaya' and 'Sibirskiy razmer'. About 120 compounds were identified. The content of a majority among groups of compounds was higher in pods than in seeds. The amount of free amino acids in pods was 47 times higher, polyols and phytosterols 5 times higher, phenolics 4 times higher, and organic acids and saponins 3 times higher than in seeds. Differences were found in the relative content of compounds. Among phenolic compounds, the dominant one for seeds was protocatechuic acid, and for pods 4-hydroxycinnamic acid. Only polyols were identified in seeds, but pods additionally contained ethanolamine, phytol, and phytosphingosine. The ratio for nonsaturated/saturated fatty acids was 2.2 in seeds and 1.4 in pods. Seeds contained more stigmasterol, and pods more beta-sitosterol. Aglycones of saponins were identified: cycloartenol in seeds, alpha- and beta-amyrins in pods. Oligosaccharides dominated in both seeds and pods. Landraces manifested higher protein content in pods, while modern cultivars had pods with higher contents of organic acids, polyols, monosaccharides, and fatty acids. The results obtained confirm the high nutritional value of asparagus bean seeds and pods, and the prospects of their use in various diets.

Possible mechanisms on related microtubule-stabilizing effects are provided. Identification of metabolites playing crucial roles in sexual incompatibility reactions in apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) was the aim of the study. Metabolic fingerprints of self-compatible and self-incompatible apricot pistils were created using liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry followed by untargeted compound search. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed 15 significant differential compounds among the total of 4006 and 1005 aligned metabolites in positive and negative ion modes, respectively. Total explained variance of 89.55% in principal component analysis (PCA) indicated high quality of differential expression analysis. The statistical analysis showed significant differences between genotypes and pollination time as well, which demonstrated high performance of the metabolic fingerprinting and revealed the presence of metabolites with significant influence on the self-incompatibility reactions. Finally, polyketide-based macrolides similar to peloruside A and a hydroxy sphingosine derivative are suggested to be significant differential metabolites in the experiment. These results indicate a strategy of pollen tubes to protect microtubules and avoid growth arrest involved in sexual incompatibility reactions of apricot.

Some patients experience progression to advanced chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) with poor long-term survivorship. Herein, we performed serum metabolomics to reveal the mechanisms of PAD pathophysiology that may improve its diagnosis and prognosis to CLTI complementary to the ankle-brachial index (ABI) and clinical presentations. Non-targeted metabolite profiling of serum was performed by multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (MSI-CE-MS) from age and sex-matched, non-diabetic, PAD participants who were recruited and clinically stratified based on the Rutherford classification into CLTI (n=18) and intermittent claudication (IC,n=20). Compared to the non-PAD controls (n=20), PAD patients had lower serum concentrations of creatine, histidine, lysine, oxoproline, monomethylarginine, as well as higher circulating phenylacetylglutamine (p<0.05). Importantly, CLTI cases exhibited higher serum concentrations of carnitine, creatinine, cystine and trimethylamine-N-oxide along with lower circulating fatty acids relative to well matched IC patients. Most serum metabolites associated with PAD progression were also correlated with ABI (r=+/- 0.24-0.59,p<0.05), whereas the ratio of stearic acid to carnitine, and arginine to propionylcarnitine differentiated CLTI from IC with good accuracy (AUC=0.87,p=4.0 x 10(-5)). This work provides new biochemical insights into PAD progression for the early detection and surveillance of high-risk patients who may require peripheral vascular intervention to prevent amputation and premature death.

Precision of a Clinical Metabolomics Profiling Platform for Use in the Identification of Inborn Errors of Metabolism	JOURNAL OF APPLIED LABORATORY MEDICINE			English	Article							ACID DECARBOXYLASE DEFICIENCY; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; ELEVATIONS; REVEALS	Background: The application of whole-exome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disease has paved the way for systems-based approaches in the clinical laboratory. Here, we describe a clinical metabolomics method for the screening of metabolic diseases through the analysis of a multi-pronged mass spectrometry platform. By simultaneously measuring hundreds of metabolites in a single sample, clinical metabolomics offers a comprehensive approach to identify metabolic perturbations across multiple biochemical pathways. Methods: We conducted a single- and multi-day precision study on hundreds of metabolites in human plasma on 4, multi-arm, high-throughput metabolomics platforms. Results: The average laboratory coefficient of variation (CV) on the 4 platforms was between 9.3 and 11.5% (median, 6.5-8.4%), average inter-assay CV on the 4 platforms ranged from 9.9 to 12.6% (median, 7.0-8.3%) and average intra-assay CV on the 4 platforms ranged from 5.7 to 6.9% (median, 3.5-4.4%). In relation to patient sample testing, the precision of multiple biomarkers associated with IEM disorders showed CVs that ranged from 0.2 to 11.0% across 4 analytical batches. Conclusions: This evaluation describes single and multi-day precision across 4 identical metabolomics platforms, comprised each of 4 independent method arms, and reproducibility of the method for the measurement of key IEM metabolites in patient samples across multiple analytical batches, providing evidence that the method is robust and reproducible for the screening of patients with inborn errors of metabolism.

Bioassay-Guided Isolation, Metabolic Profiling, and Docking Studies of Hyaluronidase Inhibitors from Ravenala madagascariensis	MOLECULES			English	Article						hyaluronidase inhibitors; Ravenala madagascariensis; metabolomics; docking	ANTIOXIDANT; SKIN; COSMECEUTICALS; FLAVONOIDS; ACID	Hyaluronidase enzyme (HAase) has a role in the dissolution or disintegration of hyaluronic acid (HA) and in maintaining the heathy state of skin. Bioassay-guided fractionation of Ravenala madagascariensis (Sonn.) organ extracts (leaf, flower, stem, and root) testing for hyaluronidase inhibition was performed followed by metabolic profiling using LC-HRMS. Additionally, a hyaluronidase docking study was achieved using Molecular Operating Environment (MOE). Results showed that the crude hydroalcoholic (70% EtOH) extract of the leaves as well as its n-butanol (n-BuOH) partition showed higher HAase activity with 64.3% inhibition. Metabolic analysis of R. madagascariensis resulted in the identification of 19 phenolic compounds ranging from different chemical classes (flavone glycosides, flavonol glycosides, and flavanol aglycones). Bioassay-guided purification of the leaf n-BuOH partition led to the isolation of seven compounds that were identified as narcissin, rutin, epiafzelechin, epicatechin, isorhamnetin 7-O-glucoside, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin-7-O-rutinoside. The docking study showed that narcissin, rutin, and quercetin 3-O-glucoside all interact with HAase through hydrogen bonding with the Asp111, Gln271, and/or Glu113 residues. Our results highlight Ravenala madagascariensis and its flavonoids as promising hyaluronidase inhibitors in natural cosmetology preparations for skin care.

Identification of pathognomonic purine synthesis biomarkers by metabolomic profiling of adolescents with obesity and type 2 diabetes	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INSULIN-RESISTANCE; GLYCEMIC CONTROL; FATTY-ACID; AMINO; SIGNATURE; RISK; DYSREGULATION; MELLITUS; REVEALS; SAMPLES	The incidence of type 2 diabetes is increasing more rapidly in adolescents than in any other age group. We identified and compared metabolite signatures in obese children with type 2 diabetes (T2D), obese children without diabetes (OB), and healthy, age- and gender-matched normal weight controls (NW) by measuring 273 analytes in fasting plasma and 24-hour urine samples from 90 subjects by targeted LC-MS/MS. Diabetic subjects were within 2 years of diagnosis in an attempt to capture early-stage disease prior to declining renal function. We found 22 urine metabolites that were uniquely associated with T2D when compared to OB and NW groups. The metabolites most significantly elevated in T2D youth included members of the betaine pathway, nucleic acid metabolism, and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and their catabolites. Notably, the metabolite pattern in OB and T2D groups differed between urine and plasma, suggesting that urinary BCAAs and their intermediates behaved as a more specific biomarker for T2D, while plasma BCAAs associated with the obese, insulin resistant state independent of diabetes status. Correlative analysis of metabolites in the T2D signature indicated that betaine metabolites, BCAAs, and aromatic amino acids were associated with hyperglycemia, but BCAA acylglycine derivatives and nucleic acid metabolites were linked to insulin resistance. Of major interest, we found that urine levels of succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide riboside (SAICA-riboside) were increased in diabetic youth, identifying urine SAICA-riboside as a potential biomarker for T2D.

Chemometric discrimination of three Pistacia species via their metabolic profiling and their possible in vitro effects on memory functions	JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOMEDICAL ANALYSIS			English	Article						Pistacia; UHPLC-ESI-MS; GC-MS; Anti-choline esterase; Anti-inflammatory activities	PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; ANTIACETYLCHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY; LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; LENTISCUS L.; LC-MS/MS; HPLC-DAD; ANTIOXIDANT; IDENTIFICATION; ANTHOCYANINS; QUANTITATION	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most widespread neurodegenerative disease; there are around ten million new cases of Alzheimer yearly worldwide especially in middle or low-income countries. Pistacia is a genus of flowering plants including the well-known, economically important P. chinensis Bunge, P. lentiscus L. and P. khinjuk. In this study, the metabolic profiling of Pistacia leaves extracts was achieved via UHPLC-ESI-MS analysis and GC-MS analysis employing chemometric analysis for their discrimination. In addition, the methanolic extracts of different Pistacia species were assessed for their anti-cholinesterase and anti-inflammatory activities by various in vitro assays. 37 and 30 metabolites belonging to different classes were identified by UHPLC-ESI-MS and GC-MS analyses respectively. Chemometric analysis revealed that P. lentiscus and P. khinjuk were more closely related chemically to each other. All studied Pistacia leaves extracts showed apparent anti-cholinesterase and anti-inflammatory activities, which promotes their use in the prevention and management of AD. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Disease severity of CAP patients was stratified using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Quantitative proteome and metabolome data, derived by LC-MS/MS, were associated to SOFA and specific parameters of SOFA using linear regression models adjusted for age, BMI, sex, smoking and technical variables. Both proteome and metabolome profiling revealed remarkable strong changes in plasma and serum composition in relation to severity of CAP. Proteins and metabolites displaying SOFA associated levels are involved in immune response, particularly in processes of lipid metabolism. Proteins, which show an association to SOFA score, are involved in acute phase response, coagulation, complement activation and inflammation. Many of these metabolites and proteins displayed not only associations to SOFA, but also to parameters of SOFA score, which likely reflect the strong influence of lung-, liver-, kidney- and heart-dysfunction on the metabolome and proteome patterns. Significance: Community-acquired pneumonia is the most frequent infection disease with high morbidity and mortality. So far, only few studies focused on the identification of proteins or metabolites associated to severity of CAP, often based on smaller sample sets. A screening for new diagnostic markers requires extensive sample collections in combination with high quality clinical data. To characterize the proteomic and metabolomics pattern associated to severity of CAP we performed a combined metabolomics and proteomic approach of serum and plasma sample from a multi-center clinical study focused on patients with CAP, requiring hospitalization. The results of this association study of omics data to the SOFA score enable not only an interpretation of changes in molecular patterns with severity of CAP but also an assignment of altered molecules to dysfunctions of respiratory, renal, coagulation, cardiovascular systems as well as liver.

An untargeted metabolomic approach for the putative characterization of metabolites from Scenedesmus obliquus in response to cadmium stress	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION			English	Article							MICROALGAE; TOXICITY; COPPER; RIVER; ZINC; IDENTIFICATION; PHYTOPLANKTON; ACCUMULATION; BIOSORPTION; BACTERIAL	Cadmium (Cd) is a widespread contaminant in aquatic systems and has a variety of toxicological implications on freshwater microorganisms. In this study, the green algae Scenedesmus obliquus was exposed to increasing Cd concentrations that inhibited growth by 20% (12.6 mu mol L-1), 30% (39.8 mu mol L-1) and 40% (83.2 mu mol L-1) and the metabolite profiles of released and cellular biomolecules were explored using an untargeted direct infusion high resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry approach. In Cd untreated cultures, intrinsic differences in composition existed between released biomolecules and freeze-dried cells. Based on putatively characterized compound groups, a greater proportion of Cys-GSH isomers and carboxyamides were present in exudates whereas sugar isomers and phosphonic acids comprised most cellular metabolites. In cultures exposed to 83.2 mu mol L-1 Cd, an overall shift in metabolomic response across both released biomolecules and cellular components resulted in an increase of lipid-based esters, and Cys-GSH isomers. These two important metabolites are used in antioxidant defense mechanisms and reactive oxygen species prevention during cellular stress. The diversity of metabolites also decreased as Cd concentrations increased when compared to untreated cultures, suggesting that overall metabolites specialize upon metal stress. We show systemic shifts from sugar and carboxylic isomers to specialized proteins and lipid isomers to help S. obliquus cope with stress. These findings highlight the potential use of this green algae as a potential biosorbent and sheds light into the metabolomics of Cd toxicology and insights into microbial metal adaptation.

As a consequence, these nanoparticles are reaching the environment as waste products, which might have a negative impact on the environment, especially on plants. This includes the elicitation of various biochemical processes in plants. In this article, we report on the changes in secondary metabolic profile of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings subjected to silver nanoparticle treatment in vitro. Briefly, various sizes (10 nm, 40 nm and 100 nm in diameter) and concentrations (0.5-5.0 ppm) of silver nanoparticles were tested. Ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with ultraviolet and fluorescence detectors as well as hyphenated to a high-resolution mass spectrometer (UPLC-PDA-FLR, UPLC-HESI-HRMS) and HPLC - ion trap mass spectrometer (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS), were applied to identify and quantify secondary metabolites. To understand whether silver ions could induce changes in the secondary metabolite profile, seedlings treated with silver nitrate in concentrations equivalent to these of nanoparticles were also analysed. The results showed significant differences in the accumulation of phenolic and indole compounds between treatments. Silver nanoparticles and silver ions induced the biosynthesis of camalexin, hydroxycamalexin 0-hexoside and hydroxycamalexin malonyl-hexoside. These compounds are important phytoalexins for Brassicaceae family (especially for Camelinae clad) and are also synthetized in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Statistically significant changes have been also observed for five phenolic compounds and 5'Glucosyl-dihydroneoascorbigen in different treatment conditions. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

However, due to lack of in vivo metabolism research, the absorbed components and metabolites of GDD have not been fully elucidated. In this study, a rapid and high-throughput ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MSE ) was applied to rapidly identify prototypes and metabolites after oral administration of GDD. On this basis, the possible metabolic pathways of the main prototypes were proposed between normal and copper-laden rats. As a result, a total of 89 GDD-related xenobiotics were detected in normal dosed rats, including 83 (36 prototypes and 47 metabolites) in plasma and 52 (21 prototypes and 31 metabolites) in liver; a total of 77 GDD-related xenobiotics were detected in copper-laden dosed rats, including 68 (31 prototypes and 37 metabolites) in plasma and 42 (19 prototypes and 23 metabolites) in liver. Our findings showed that anthraquinones, alkaloids and protostane triterpenoids as well as a few saponins, flavonoids, tannins and curcuminoids were the main absorbed chemical components of GDD in rat plasma; anthraquinones, protostane triterpenoids and curcuminoids were the major components in rat liver. Glucuronidation and sulfation were deduced to be the predominant metabolic pathways of GDD. Methylation, acetylation, reduction, hydroxylation, demethylation and deglycosylation were often occurred in the metabolic process. Furthermore, the holistic metabolic profile of GDD revealed that copper-laden rats and normal rats had certain differences in drug absorption and metabolism. This study offered a solid basis for ascertaining bioactive components and action mechanism of GDD.

Objectives This study compared the ability of two platforms (Agilent UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS and Waters UPLC-IMS-QTOF-MS) to identify biomarkers in butterhead and romaine lettuce cultivars. Methods Two case studies by different metabolomics platforms: (1) Waters and Agilent datasets processed by the same data pre-processing software (Progenesis QI), and (2) Datasets processed by different data pre-processing software. Results A higher number of candidate biomarkers shared between sample groups in case 2 (101) than in case 1 (26) was found. Thirteen metabolites were common to both cases. Romaine lettuce was characterised by phenolic compounds including flavonoids, hydroxycinnamate derivatives, and 9-undecenal, while Butterhead showed sesquiterpene lactones and xanthosine. This study demonstrates that high percentages of the most discriminatory entities can be obtained by using the manufacturers' embedded pre-processing software and following the recommended processing data guidelines using commercial software to normalise the data matrix.

However, up to now, no objective methods were developed to diagnose depression in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected patients. Therefore, the dual metabolomic platforms were used here to identify potential biomarkers for diagnosing HBV-infected patients with depression (dHB). Methods: Both gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based and nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomic platforms were used to conduct urine metabolic profiling of dHB subjects and HBV-infected patients without depression (HB). Orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis was used to identify the differential metabolites between dHB subjects and HB subjects, and the step-wise logistic regression analysis was used to identify potential biomarkers. Results: In total, 21 important metabolites responsible for distinguishing dHB subjects from HB subjects were identified. Meanwhile, seven potential biomarkers (alpha-ydroxyisobutyric acid, hippuric acid, azelaic acid, isobutyric acid, malonic acid, levulinic acid, and phenylacetylglycine) were viewed as potential biomarkers. The simplified biomarker panel consisting of these seven metabolites had an excellent diagnostic performance in discriminating dHB subjects from HB subjects. Moreover, this panel could yield a higher accuracy in separating dHB subjects from HB subjects than our previous panels (identified by single metabolomic platform) did. Conclusion: These results suggested that the dual metabolomic platforms could yield a better urinary biomarker panel for dHB subjects than any single metabolomic platform did, and our results could be helpful for developing an objective method in future to diagnose depression in HBV-infected patients.

Epidermal stem cells (EpSCs) were cultured in a rotary cell culture system (RCCS) bioreactor to simulate microgravity. The metabolites of EpSCs were identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Compared with normal gravity (NG) group, a total of 57 different metabolites of EpSCs were identified (P < 0.05, VIP > 1), including lipids and lipid-like molecules (51 molecules), amino acids (5 molecules), nucleosides, nucleotides, and analogues (1 molecule). According to the partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) score plot, a VIP > 1 and P < 0.05 were obtained for the 57 different metabolites, of which 23 molecules were significantly downregulated and 34 were significantly upregulated in simulated microgravity (SMG) group. These results showed that SMG has a significant impact on different pathways, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis indicated that multiple pathways were involved, mainly the amino acid metabolism pathway, lipid metabolism pathway, membrane transport pathway, and cell growth and death pathways. Thus, the metabolic profile of EpSCs was changed under SMG. Exploring the metabolic profile of EpSCs would be helpful to further understand the growth characteristics of EpSCs under SMG, which will provide a new approach to explore the metabolomics mechanism of stress injury and repair trauma under SMG.

We sought to identify metabolomic profiles of blood pressure, and to explore their mediation effects on the coarse grain intake-blood pressure association among young adults free of hypertension. Methods and results: Plasma metabolome of 86 participants from the Carbohydrate Alternatives and Metabolic Phenotypes study was characterized by untargeted lipidomics and metabolomics using liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry. We identified 24 and 117 metabolites associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), respectively, using random forest modeling and partial correlation analysis. Moreover, metabolite panels for highly specific prediction of blood pressure (8 metabolites for SBP and 11 metabolites for DBP) were determined using ten-fold cross-validated ridge regression (R-2 >= 0.70). We also observed an inverse association between metabolite panel of SBP (beta +/- SE = -0.02 +/- 0.01, P = 0.04) or DBP (beta +/- SE = -0.03 0.01, P = 0.02) and coarse grain intake. Furthermore, we observed significant mediating effects of metabolites, in particular, sphingolipid ceramides, on the association between coarse grain exposure and blood pressure using both bias-corrected bootstrap tests and high-dimensional mediation analysis adapted for large-scale and high-throughput omics data. Conclusions: We identified metabolomic profiles specifically associated with blood pressure in young Chinese adults without diagnosed hypertension. The inverse association between coarse grain intake and blood pressure may be mediated by sphingolipid metabolites.

Besides, consumers are endangered by the formation of toxic secondary metabolites. Some of these secondary metabolites are chemically characterized as mycotoxins, but the majority of the Alternaria mycobolome still remains unknown. Methods and results Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) and LC-MS/MS are combined for the non-targeted and targeted analysis of the metabolome of three A. alternata isolates and one A. solani isolate. Due to the ultra-high resolution of FTICR-MS, unique molecular formulae are assigned to measured m/z signals. The molecular formulae are matched to entries of the databases Antibase and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. The non-targeted analysis of the fungal extracts reveals variations in the secondary metabolite profile of A. alternata and A. solani. Differences in the biosynthesis of dibenzo-alpha-pyrones, perylene quinones, tentoxin, and tenuazonic acid of the A. alternata and A. solani isolates are determined applying targeted LC-MS/MS. Conclusion FTICR-MS analyses reveal clear differences in the metabolic profile of the A. solani and the A. alternata isolates.

Biological characteristics of the fungal pathogen and the molecular interactions betweenA. apisand honey bees have been studied extensively. However, little is known about the effects ofA. apisinfection on antioxidant enzyme activities and metabolic profiles of the gut of honey bee larvae. In this study, sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and LC-MS based untargeted metabolomic analysis were employed to determine the changes in the specific activities of antioxidant enzymes and the metabolomic profiles in gut tissues ofA. apis-infected larvae (10(5)A. apisspores per larva) and controls. Results showed that specific activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione S-transferase were significantly higher in the guts of the control larvae than in the guts of theA. apis-infected larvae. The metabolomic data revealed that levels of 28 and 52 metabolites were significantly higher and lower, respectively, in the guts ofA. apis-infected larvae than in the guts of control larvae. The 5-oxo-ETE level in the infected larvae was two times higher than that in the control larvae. Elevated 5-oxo-ETE levels may act as a potential metabolic biomarker for chalkbrood disease diagnosis, suggesting thatA. apisinfection induced obvious oxidative stress in the honey bee larvae. The levels of metabolites such as taurine, docosahexaenoic acid, and L-carnitine involved in combating oxidative stress were significantly decreased in the gut ofA. apis-infected larvae. Overall, our results suggest thatA. apisinfection may compromise the ability of infected larvae to cope with oxidative stress, providing new insight into changing patterns of physiological responses toA. apisinfection in honey bee larvae by concurrent use of conventional biochemical assays and untargeted metabolomics.

Although some reports addressed their anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic, and antituberculotic effects, their hepatoprotective potential is yet to be discovered. Accordingly, this study investigated the crude extract and different fractions of the plant leaves; metabolic profiling using liquid chromatography/high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (LC-HRESIMS) analysis,in silicoabsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties for the dereplicated metabolite via online PreADMET program, ROS scavenger activity on the Hep G2 human liver cancer cell line, and the possible hepatic cellular treatment effects in alcohol-inflamed liver female Wistar albino rats. Metabolic profiling dereplicated a total of 28 metabolites from the crude extract and its various fractions. In silico ADMET and ROS scavenger activity screening suggested plant metabolites are of potential bioactivity. In vivo hepatic treatment with crude, defatted crude, and n-hexane leave extracts suggested all extracts significantly improved liver damage, which was indicated by the reduction of elevated serum levels of bilirubin, AST, ALT, ALP, CRP, TNF-alpha, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and MDA. The reduced levels of GSH and TAC were normalized during the study. Histological examinations of liver tissue showed collagen fiber distribution nearly back to its normal pattern. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potentials ofPremna odorataextracts could be partly related to the combined effects of these phytochemicals or their synergistic interactions.

However, there are few metabolomics studies related to the effects of polyphenols in humans. In this study, we performed a mass spectrometry-based metabolomics analysis of urine samples from participants with a body mass index (BMI) higher than 25 kg/m(2)and lower than 30 kg/m(2)to investigate the effects of the intake of seapolynol isolated fromE. cava. Metabolomic profiling showed that the levels of riboflavin, urocanic acid, 5-hydroxy-6-methoxyindole glucuronide, and guanidino valeric acid were significantly increased in the seapolynol intake group compared with the placebo group. A correlation analysis was performed to identify the association between the metabolites' levels and clinical characteristics related to body fat. Among the metabolites whose concentrations changed in the seapolynol intake group, riboflavin was associated with BMI, body weight, fat mass, and percent body fat. These findings suggest that the decreased body fat induced by the intake of seapolynol is related to an increase in the antioxidant effect of riboflavin.

However, its biochemical effects at the metabolic level compared with those of other insect growth regulators have not been studied. Therefore, in this study, a GC-MS based untargeted metabolomics approach was applied to compare azadirachtin with pyriproxyfen (a juvenile hormone analog) and tebufenozide (a molting hormone analog) in terms of their metabolic effects on Bactrocera dorsalis larvae. The bioactivity of azadirachtin against B. dorsalis larvae was significantly different than those of pyriproxyfen and tebufenozide. A total of 693 mass features were recognized, and 112 metabolites were identified in this study. The results showed that a total of 16, 13 and 10 differentially regulated metabolites corresponding to 12, 5 and 8 pathways occur in Aza versus CK, Pyr versus CK and Teb versus CK group, respectively. Further analysis showed that 6 differentially regulated metabolites corresponding to 5 key pathways could be the primary differential metabolic response of B. dorsalis larvae to the three insect growth regulators. The pathways were myoinositol corresponding to ascorbate and aldarate metabolism as the specific response of B. dorsalis larvae to azadirachtin; xylitol, xylulose and 3-aminopropionitrile corresponding to pentose and glucuronate interconversions, and cyanoamino acid metabolism as the common responses to azadirachtin and pyriproxyfen; and 3-hydroxypropionic acid and beta-alanine corresponding to propanoate metabolism and beta-alanine metabolism as the specific responses to tebufenozide. The results showed that the metabolic response of B. dorsalis larvae to azadirachitin is closer to that of pyriproxyfen than tebufenozide.

Though serum-derived exosomes are an emerging type of liquid biopsy, the metabolite content of these vesicles remains under researched. The aim of this pilot study was to compare the metabolite profiles of the whole serum and serum-derived exosomes in the context of differences between cancer patients and healthy controls as well as patients' response to radiotherapy (RT). Methods: Serum samples were collected from 10 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with head and neck cancer before and after RT. Metabolites extracted from serum and exosomes were analyzed by the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Results: An untargeted GC-MS-based approach identified 182 and 46 metabolites in serum and exosomes, respectively. Metabolites that differentiated cancer and control samples, either serum or exosomes, were associated with energy metabolism. Serum metabolites affected by RT were associated with the metabolism of amino acids, sugars, lipids, and nucleotides. Conclusions: cancer-related features of energy metabolism could be detected in both types of specimens. On the other hand, in contrast to RT-induced changes observed in serum metabolome, this pilot study did not reveal a specific radiation-related pattern of exosome metabolites.

To elucidate the mode of action, comprehensive metabolite profiling in the plasma before and after administration of THM is essential. Objective The aim of this study was to explore and identify/annotate converted metabolites after administration of THM in humans. Methods We performed untargeted metabolome analysis of human plasma collected before and after administration of maoto (ma-huang-tang), a traditional Japanese Kampo medicine. Maoto-derived metabolites were then selected and annotated following the DAC-Met strategy, which is an annotation method that uses mass differences of major metabolic reactions among the detected peaks and a differential network analysis. Results About 80% of maoto-derived components were found to be converted forms. Following DAC-Met, the structures of 15 previously unidentified metabolites were determined, and five of these were later confirmed with authentic standards. Using published literature, we also reconstructed the metabolic pathway of maoto components in humans. A kinetic time-course analysis revealed their diverse kinetic profiles. Conclusion The results demonstrated that time-resolved comprehensive metabolite profiling in plasma using the DAC-Met strategy is highly useful for elucidating the complex nature of THM.

Using the 'Knife to sample the aerosol of cauterized specimens, we demonstrate a new mode of real-time diagnosis, coupling metabolic phenotype to mutant PIK3CA genotype. Oncogenic PIK3CA results in an increase in arachidonic acid and a concomitant overproduction of eicosanoids, acting to promote cell proliferation beyond a cell-autonomous manner Mechanistically, mutant PIK3CA drives a multimodal signaling network involving mTORC2-PKC zeta-mediated activation of the calcium-dependent phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). Notably, inhibiting cPLA2 synergizes with fatty acid-free diet to restore immunogenicity and selectively reduce mutant PIK3CA-induced tumorigenicity. Besides highlighting the potential for metabolic phenotyping in stratified medicine, this study reveals an important role for activated PI3K signaling in regulating arachidonic acid metabolism, uncovering a targetable metabolic vulnerability that largely depends on dietary fat restriction.

Fourteen crossbred growing barrows (BW = 23.70 +/- 1.29 kg) fitted with jugular cannula were randomly allocated to the SB and control (Con) groups, each group consisted of seven replicates (pens), with one pig per pen. At 9:00 of each day during the experimental period, pigs in the SB group were infused with 10 mL of SB (200 mmol/L, pH 7.4, 37 degrees C) via precaval vein, while the Con group was treated with the same volume of physiological saline. On day 4, the blood of each pig was collected at 0, 30, 60, and 120 min after the intravenous infusion. Metabolites in the serum were detected by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry analysis. Pathway analysis of metabolomic profiles showed that the differential metabolites mainly enriched in amino acid metabolism, lipid-related metabolism, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. More importantly, the relative concentrations of all eight essential amino acids, five non-essential amino acids, and two amino acid derivatives were decreased by the parenteral SB. In addition, SB significantly increased the relative concentrations of eicosanoic acid and octadecanoic acid and decreased the relative concentration of glycerol-3-phosphate at 0 min (three days after intravenous infusion of SB), which suggests that parenteral SB may increase stearates mobilization and decrease the biosynthesis of stearates. In conclusion, intravenous infusion of SB may induce more amino acids to synthesize proteins and affect fat metabolism through increasing fat mobilization and decreasing the biosynthesis of stearates. However, a further study is needed to understand the mechanism of extensive metabolic pathway changes induced by parenteral SB.

Consequently, multinucleated myofibers and resident mononucleated stem cells (satellite cells) generate several metabolites, which enter into circulation affecting the function of other organs, especially during exercise and atrophy. The present study was aimed at building a comprehensive profile of metabolites in primary human skeletal muscle cells during myogenic progression in an untargeted metabolomics approach using a high resolution Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid Mass Spectrometer. Identification of metabolites with multivariate statistical analyses showed a global shift in metabolomic profiles between myoblasts undergoing proliferation and differentiation along with distinctly separable profiles between early and late differentiating cultures. Pathway analyses of 71 unique metabolites revealed that Pantothenate metabolism and Coenzyme A biosynthesis and Arginine Proline metabolism play dominant roles in proliferating myoblasts, while metabolites involved in vitamin B6, Glyoxylate and Dicarboxylate, Nitrogen, Glutathione, and Tryptophan metabolism were upregulated during differentiation. We found that early and late differentiating cultures displayed differences in Phenylalanine, Tyrosine, Glycine, Serine and Threonine metabolism. Our results identify metabolites during maturation of muscle from progenitor myoblasts that have implications in muscle regeneration and pathophysiology.

The study was aimed at evaluating efficacy of osthole against osteoporosis using high-throughput metabolomics method. The blood samples for illustrating the pathological mechanism of PMOP and exploring the efficacy of osthole treatment (ST) were collected to perform metabolites and metabolic profiles and pathways analysis using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) and pattern recognition methods. In addition, backbone weight, the bone density, and some vital biochemical indexes were also detected. A total of 28 metabolites were identified as biomarkers for ovariectomized-osteoporosis model, and ST could significantly regulate 19 of them including lysine, linoleic acid, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, prostaglandin F2a, taurocholic acid, LysoPC(15:0), l-carnitine, glucose, arginine, citric acid, corticosterone, ornithine, tryptophan, arachidonic acid, Cer(d18:0/18:0), glutamine, uric acid, 8-HETE, estriol, which mainly related with 13 metabolic pathways, such as linoleic acid metabolism, starch, and sucrose metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, citrate cycle (TCA cycle), and arginine biosynthesis. The ovariectomized model (OVX) rats display a significant decrease bone density, TGF-beta 1, NO, and NOS level, and a significant increase bone weight, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and Ca (2+) level. These parameters in the ST rats were evidently improved as compared to the OVX group. ST effectively mitigated ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis in rats by affecting endogenous metabolite-related metabolic mechanism and showed the natural alternative with potential for the treatment of PMOP.

In this study, the metabolomes of THP-1, U937, KG-1 (acute myelogenous leukemia, AML), K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia, CML), and cord blood-derived CD34-positive hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and specific metabolic alterations were found using multivariate statistical analysis. Compared to HSCs, leukemia cell metabolomes were found to have significant alterations, among which three were related to amino acids, three to sugars, and five to fatty acids. Compared to CML, four metabolomes were observed specifically in AML. Given that overall more metabolites are present in leukemia cells than in HSCs, we observed that the activation of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) metabolism facilitated the incidence of leukemia and the proliferation of leukemic cells. Analysis of metabolome profiles specifically present in HSCs and leukemia cells greatly increases our basic understanding of cellular metabolic characteristics, which is valuable fundamental knowledge for developing novel anticancer drugs targeting leukemia metabolism.

The tuberous roots of yacon accumulate a diverse array of probiotic and bioactive metabolites including fructooligosaccharides and caffeic acid esters. However, the metabolic diversity of yacon remains unexplored, including the site of biosynthesis and accumulation of key metabolite classes. We report herein a multidisciplinary approach involving metabolomics, gene expression and scanning electron microscopy, to provide a comprehensive analysis of the diversity, distribution and spatial regulation of the specialized metabolism in yacon. Our results demonstrate that different metabolic fingerprints and gene expression patterns characterize specific tissues, organs and cultivars of yacon. Manual inspection of mass spectrometry data and molecular networking allowed the tentative identification of 71 metabolites, including undescribed structural analogues of known bioactive compounds. Imaging by scanning electron microscopy revealed the presence of a new type of glandular trichome in yacon bracts, with a distinctive metabolite profile. Furthermore, the high concentration of sesquiterpene lactones in capitate glandular trichomes and the restricted presence of certain flavonoids and caffeic acid esters in underground organs and internal tissues suggests that these metabolites could be involved in protective and ecological functions. This study demonstrates that individual organs and tissues make specific contributions to the highly diverse and specialized metabolome of yacon, which is proving to be a reservoir of previously undescribed molecules of potential significance in human health.

J	Sake, CL; Newman, DM; Boyle, NR				Sake, Cara L.; Newman, Darrian M.; Boyle, Nanette R.			Evaluation of quenching methods for metabolite recovery in photoautotrophic Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002	BIOTECHNOLOGY PROGRESS			English	Article						intracellular; metabolite leakage; metabolomics; methanol quenching; sampling techniques; Synechococcus	MICROBIAL METABOLOMICS; EXTRACTION; QUANTIFICATION	The first step of many metabolomics studies is quenching, a technique vital for rapidly halting metabolism and ensuring that the metabolite profile remains unchanging during sample processing. The most widely used approach is to plunge the sample into prechilled cold methanol; however, this led to significant metabolite loss in Synecheococcus sp. PCC 7002. Here we describe our analysis of the impacts of cold methanol quenching on the model marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, as well as our brief investigation of alternative quenching methods. We tested several methods including cold methanol, cold saline, and two filtration approaches. Targeted central metabolites were extracted and metabolomic profiles were generated using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The results indicate that cold methanol quenching induces dramatic metabolite leakage in Synechococcus, resulting in a majority of central metabolites being lost prior to extraction. Alternatively, usage of a chilled saline quenching solution mitigates metabolite leakage and improves sample recovery without sacrificing rapid quenching of cellular metabolism. Finally, we illustrate that metabolite leakage can be assessed, and subsequently accounted for, in order to determine absolute metabolite pool sizes; however, our results show that metabolite leakage is inconsistent across various metabolite pools and therefore must be determined for each individually measured metabolite.

Previous studies demonstrated that dietary meat species could differently affect physiological functions; however, the mechanisms of this remain unclear. To explore the physiological effects of dietary defatted meat species, especially on metabolism, we investigated their influence on the metabolomic profiles of the liver, gastrocnemius muscle, and cecal content in mice. Casein (control) or a defatted meat species (beef leg, pork leg, chicken leg, or chicken breast) was supplied as the major protein source in the diet for four weeks, and metabolism-related molecules were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We found that various metabolite levels in tissues and cecal content differed according to the types of dietary protein consumed. Specifically, differences in carnosine, 1,5-anhydro-glucitol, inositol, butyric acid, and propionic acid were clearly observed. Among them, the highest carnosine intake by dietary pork leg was clearly related to the highest carnosine level in the liver. In addition, taurine intake was suggested to be linked to some metabolic pathways including taurine and hypotaurine metabolism in cecal content. These results provide additional knowledge of the effects of different dietary meat species on human and animal health.

Understanding how human metabolism is influenced by these treatments is crucial to predict the individual response and adjust personalized therapies. Here, we aimed to compare profiles of metabolites in serum of head and neck cancer patients treated with concurrent chemo-radiotherapy, radiotherapy alone, or induction chemotherapy. Serum samples were analyzed by a targeted quantitative approach using combined direct flow injection and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, which allowed simultaneous quantification of 149 metabolites. There were 45 metabolites whose levels were significantly changed between pretreatment and within- or post-treatment serum samples, including 38 phospholipids. Concurrent chemo-radiotherapy induced faster and stronger effects than radiotherapy alone. On the other hand, chemotherapy alone did not result in significant changes. The decreased level of total phospholipids was the most apparent effect observed during the first step of the treatment. This corresponded to the loss of patients' body mass, yet no correlation between both parameters was observed for individual patients. We concluded that different molecular changes were measured at the level of serum metabolome in response to different treatment modalities.

In just one of the previously published works on Brazilian olive oil, the assessed samples were commercially available. In this study, a comprehensive characterization of EVOO samples acquired at local stores (at Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul, from the two most prevalent cultivars, Arbequina and Koroneiki) was carried out considering the most relevant quality parameters, antioxidant capacity, oxidative stability, total phenolic content, fatty acid composition, and minor component metabolic profiling. The latter included: (1) the determination of individual phenolic compounds (belonging to four diverse chemical classes) and triterpenic acids by means of a powerful multi-class reversed-phase LC-MS method; (2) the quantitative profiling of tocopherols, phytosterols, and pigments by normal-phase LC-DAD/fluorescence; and (3) the quantitative appraisal of the volatile pattern of the oils by solid-phase microextraction (SPME)-gas chromatography (GC)-MS. By applying these methods, the concentrations of approximately 70 minor compounds were determined in commercial EVOOs from Brazil. To the best of our knowledge, the content of a very large number of phenolic compounds of those determined in the current report (mainly secoiridoids), the three triterpenic acids (maslinic, betulinic, and oleanolic acids), and the individual chlorophyll derivatives had not been previously evaluated in Brazilian EVOOs. The present work provides a broad picture of the compositional profile and other parameters of relevance of selected commercial Brazilian EVOOs available on local markets, describing their typicity and most particular features, some of which are known to have potential impacts on consumers' health.

For example, microorganisms can serve as microbial endocrine mediators and can respond to stimuli and produce neurochemicals, ultimately influencing the brain-gut-microbiome axis of their host, a bidirectional communication system between the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract, especially during developmental stages. To begin to explore potential dynamic changes of the gut microbiome, we characterized gut microbiota in adolescent rats that underwent a fixed period of restraint stress, examined whether the gut microbial population and their metabolic functions were changed by stress, and if such changes during adolescence persist or recover in young adulthood. Integrated 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing and liquid chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) based metabolic profiling were utilized to discover any significant differences in gut microbial genus and microbial metabolites immediately at the end of the chronic restraint stress and three weeks after the stress treatment, compared to control rats that did not receive stress treatment. Interestingly, while adolescent chronic stress-induced differences in relative microbial abundance (i.e., microbial species and distribution) disappeared three weeks after the stress treatment ended, the differences in microbial metabolic profiles persisted into adulthood. In addition, a number of significantly altered metabolites and their correlated gut microbes detected in our study facilitated a possible connection between gut microbiota and host stress response, which can be further investigated in the future to study the causal relationship between gut microbial metabolites and their impact on human health.

Plasma Metabolomic Changes in Mice With Time-restricted Feeding-attenuated Spontaneous Metastasis of Lewis Lung Carcinoma	ANTICANCER RESEARCH			English	Article						Metabolomics; plasma; diet; time-restricted feeding; Lewis lung carcinoma; mice	HIGH-FAT; MAMMARY CARCINOGENESIS; CANCER; OBESITY; TUMORS; ACIDS	Background/Aim: Time-restricted feeding (TRF) during the dark phase of the day restores metabolic homeostasis in mice. Materials and Methods: We performed untargeted metabolomic analysis on plasma from mice subjected to TRF that attenuates high-fat diet-enhanced spontaneous metastasis of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC). Results: Twenty-four of 152 identified metabolites differed among the four dietary groups (non-LLC-bearing mice fed the AIN93G diet and LLC-bearing mice fed the AIN93G, the high-fat diet (HFD), or TRF of the HFD). Component 1 of sparse partial least squares-discriminant analysis showed a clear separation between non-LLC-bearing and LLC-bearing mice. Major metabolites responsible for the changes were elevations in a-tocopherol, docosahexaenoic acid, cholesterol, dihydrocholestrol, isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine and decreases in lactic acid and pyruvic acid in LLC-bearing mice particularly those fed the HFD. Time-restricted feeding shifted the metabolic profile of LLC-bearing mice towards that of non-LLC-bearing controls. Conclusion: Time-restricted feeding improves metabolic profile of LLC-bearing mice.

The usefulness of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue material for metabolomics analysis as compared with fresh frozen tissue material remains unclear. LC/MS-MS-based metabolomics analysis was performed on 11 pairs of matched tumor and normal tissues in both FFPE and fresh frozen tissue materials from patients with colorectal carcinoma. Permutation t test was applied to identify metabolites with differential abundance between tumor and normal tissues. A total of 200 metabolites were detected in the FFPE samples and 536 in the fresh frozen samples. The preservation of metabolites in FFPE samples was diverse according to classes and chemical characteristics, ranging from 78% (energy) to 0% (peptides). Compared with the normal tissues, 34 (17%) and 174 (32%) metabolites were either accumulated or depleted in the tumor tissues derived from FFPE and fresh frozen samples, respectively. Among them, 15 metabolites were common in both FFPE and fresh frozen samples. Notably, branched chain amino acids were highly accumulated in tumor tissues. Using KEGG pathway analyses, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, arginine and proline, glycerophospholipid, and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism pathways distinguishing tumor from normal tissues were found in both FFPE and fresh frozen samples. This study demonstrates that informative data of metabolic profiles can be retrieved from FFPE tissue materials.

Liver metabolite profiles of Muscovy ducks at different egg-laying stages from the perspective of nontargeted metabolomics were analyzed in this study. Twelve Muscovy ducks were selected at pre-laying (22 weeks, TT group), laying (40 weeks, FT group), and postlaying (60 weeks, ST group) stages, resulting in 36 hepatic metabolite profiles by using ultra-high- performance liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry. A total of 324 differential metabolites (156 increased and 168 decreased) in FT as compared to the TT (FT/TT) group and 332 differential metabolites (120 increased and 212 decreased) in ST as compared to the FT (ST/FT) group were screened out. Metabolic pathways enriched in FT/TT and ST/FT groups were mainly amino acid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and vitamin metabolism. The amino acid metabolism pathways were upregulated in the FT/TT group and downregulated in the ST/FT group (P < 0.05). The glutathione and ascorbic acid abundances were downregulated, and the choline abundance was upregulated during egg laying (P < 0.05). The liver provides amino acids, lipids, nucleotides, vitamins, and choline, and so on, which are essential materials for yolk precursor synthesis. The decrease in the abundance of glutathione and ascorbic acid indicates that Muscovy ducks might be in a relatively stable physiological state during egg laying.

A Two-Way Interaction between Methotrexate and the Gut Microbiota of Male Sprague-Dawley Rats	JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH			English	Article						methotrexate; gastrointestinal toxicity; gut microbiome; metabolic phenotyping mass spectrometry; amplicon sequencing	HIGH-DOSE METHOTREXATE; METABOLISM; INHIBITION; PHARMACOKINETICS; ACETYLCHOLINE; DISCOVERY; TOXICITY; RELEASE; RESCUE; PLASMA	Methotrexate (MTX) is a chemotherapeutic agent that can cause a range of toxic side effects including gastrointestinal damage, hepatotoxicity, myelosuppression, and nephrotoxicity and has potentially complex interactions with the gut microbiome. Following untargeted UPLC-qtof-MS analysis of urine and fecal samples from male Sprague-Dawley rats administered at either 0, 10, 40, or 100 mg/kg of MTX, dose-dependent changes in the endogenous metabolite profiles were detected. Semiquantitative targeted UPLC-MS detected MTX excreted in urine as well as MTX and two metabolites, 2,4-diamino-N-10-methylpteroic acid (DAMPA) and 7-hydroxy-MTX, in the feces. DAMPA is produced by the bacterial enzyme carboxypeptidase glutamate 2 (CPDG2) in the gut. Microbiota profiling (16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) of fecal samples showed an increase in the relative abundance of Firmicutes over the Bacteroidetes at low doses of MTX but the reverse at high doses. Firmicutes relative abundance was positively correlated with DAMPA excretion in feces at 48 h, which were both lower at 100 mg/kg compared to that seen at 40 mg/kg. Overall, chronic exposure to MTX appears to induce community and functionality changes in the intestinal microbiota, inducing downstream perturbations in CPDG2 activity, and thus may delay MTX detoxication to DAMPA, This reduction in metabolic clearance might be associated with increased gastrointestinal toxicity.

APCCs have been suggested as possible precursors of APAs because they frequently carry driver mutations for constitutive aldosterone production, and a few adrenal lesions with histopathologic features of both APCCs and APAs have been identified. Our objective was to investigate the metabolic phenotypes of APCCs (n=27) compared with APAs (n=6) using in situ matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded adrenals from patients with unilateral primary aldosteronism. Specific distribution patterns of metabolites were associated with APCCs and classified 2 separate APCC subgroups (subgroups 1 and 2) indistinguishable by CYP11B2 immunohistochemistry. Metabolic profiles of APCCs in subgroup 1 were tightly clustered and distinct from subgroup 2 and APAs. Multiple APCCs from the same adrenal displayed metabolic profiles of the same subgroup. Metabolites of APCC subgroup 2 were highly similar to the APA group and indicated enhanced metabolic pathways favoring cell proliferation compared with APCC subgroup 1. In conclusion, we demonstrate specific subgroups of APCCs with strikingly divergent distribution patterns of metabolites. One subgroup displays a metabolic phenotype convergent with APAs and may represent the progression of APCCs to APAs.

In this study, the antibacterial activity of the leaf and stem bark extracts of the plant against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), as well as the metabolite profiles of the bioactive fractions, was investigated. The antibacterial activity was determined by disc diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), while the microbial reduction by the bioactive fraction was evaluated using time-kill test. The bioactive fraction was further subjected to ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS) analysis to putatively identify the chemical constituents contained therein. All the extracts and fractions showed different levels of antibacterial activity on the tested MRSA strains. The highest total antibacterial activity, i.e., 4007.6 mL/g, was exhibited by the crude leaf methanolic extract. However, the ethyl acetate fraction of the leaf showed moderate to significant antibacterial activity against MRSA at low MIC (0.08-1.25 mg/mL). Metabolite profiling of this fraction using UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS resulted in the putative identification of 28 compounds, which included phenolic acids, flavan-3-ols and flavonols. The results of this study showed that the ethyl acetate fraction of Arbutus pavarii leaf possessed potential antibacterial activity against MRSA and hence can be further explored for pharmaceutical applications as a natural antibacterial agent.

However, the association between vitiligo and the gut microbiome remains to be elucidated. Thus, we conducted a case-control study through 16S rRNA sequencing and serum untargeted-metabolomic profiling based on 30 vitiligo patients and 30 matched healthy controls. In vitiligo patients, the microbial composition was distinct from that of healthy controls according to the analysis on alpha- and beta-diversity (P < 0.05), with a characteristic decreased Bacteroidetes: Firmicutes ratio. Meanwhile, the levels of 23 serum metabolites (including taurochenodeoxycholate and L-NG-monomethyl-arginine) in the vitiligo patients were different from those in the healthy individuals and showed significant correlations with some microbial markers. We found that Corynebacterium 1, Ruminococcus 2, Jeotgalibaca and Psychrobacter were correlated significantly with disease duration and serum IL-1 beta level in vitiligo patients. And Psychrobacter was identified as the most predictive features for vitiligo by machine learning analysis ("importance" = 0.0236). Finally, combining multi-omics data and joint prediction models with accuracies up to 0.929 were established with dominant contribution of Corynebacterium 1 and Psychrobacter. Our findings replenished the previously unknown relationship between gut dysbiosis and vitiligo circulating metabolome and enrolled the gut-skin axis into the understanding of vitiligo pathogenesis.

This study aimed to reveal the relationship between gut microbiota and the metabolome at different ages, as well as the anti-aging effect of FTZ, which is an effective clinical prescription for the treatment of hyperlipidemia and diabetes. Methods: In the present study, mice were randomly divided into different age and FTZ treatment groups. The aging-relevant behavioral phenotype the levels of blood glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, free fatty acids, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and cytokine TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8 in the serum were measured. Changes of serum metabolties were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS). Gut microbiota were identified using 16S rDNA sequencing. Results: Our results indicated that with age, the aging-relevant behavioral phenotype appeared, glucose and lipid metabolism disordered, secretion levels of cytokine TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-8 increased. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio changed with age, first increasing and then decreasing, and the microbial diversity and the community richness of the aging mice were improved by FTZ. The abundance of opportunistic bacteria decreased (Lactobacillus murinus, Erysipelatoclostridium), while the levels of protective bacteria such as Butyricimonas, Clostridium and Akkermansia increased. Metabolic analysis identified 24 potential biomarkers and 10 key pathways involving arachidonic acid metabolism, phospholipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism. Correlation analysis between the gut microbiota and biomarkers suggested that the relative abundance of protective bacteria was negatively correlated with the levels of leukotriene E4, 20-HETE and arachidonic acid, which was different from protective bacteria. Conclusion: Shifts of gut microbiota and metabolomic profiles were observed in the mice during the normal aging process, and treatment with FTZ moderately corrected the aging, which may be mediated via interference with arachidonic acid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism and gut microbiota in mice.

Prior work has demonstrated that plasma metabolite profiles of children with ASD become more similar to those of their typically developing (TD) peers following this treatment. This work measures the concentration of 669 biochemical compounds in feces of a cohort of 18 ASD and 20 TD children using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy. Subsequent measurements were taken from the ASD cohort over the course of 10-week Microbiota Transfer Therapy (MTT) and 8 weeks after completion of this treatment. Univariate and multivariate statistical analysis techniques were used to characterize differences in metabolites before, during, and after treatment. Using Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA), it was possible to attain multivariate metabolite models capable of achieving a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 95% after cross-validation. Observations made following MTT indicate that the fecal metabolite profiles become more like those of the TD cohort. There was an 82-88% decrease in the median difference of the ASD and TD group for the panel metabolites, and among the top fifty most discriminating individual metabolites, 96% report more comparable values following treatment. Thus, these findings are similar, although less pronounced, as those determined using plasma metabolites.

However, identifying significant associations between metabolites and tissue-specific phenotypes requires a multi-omics approach. In a cohort of 42 subjects with different levels of glucose tolerance (normal, prediabetes and T2D) matched for age and body mass index, we calculated associations between parameters of whole-body positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp and non-targeted metabolomics profiling for subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and plasma. Plasma metabolomics profiling revealed that hepatic fat content was positively associated with tyrosine, and negatively associated with lysoPC(P-16:0). Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and SAT insulin sensitivity (K-i), were positively associated with several lysophospholipids, while the opposite applied to branched-chain amino acids. The adipose tissue metabolomics revealed a positive association between non-esterified fatty acids and, VAT and liver K-i. Bile acids and carnitines in adipose tissue were inversely associated with VAT K-i. Furthermore, we detected several metabolites that were significantly higher in T2D than normal/prediabetes. In this study we present novel associations between several metabolites from SAT and plasma with the fat fraction, volume and insulin sensitivity of various tissues throughout the body, demonstrating the benefit of an integrative multi-omics approach.

Objectives: To identify plasma metabolomic signatures of Pb exposure, as measured in blood and toenails. Methods: In a subset of men from the VA Normative Aging Study, mass-spectrometry based plasma metabolomic profiling was performed. Pb levels were measured in blood samples and toenail clippings collected concurrently. Multivariable linear regression models, smoothing splines and Pathway analyses were employed to identify metabolites associated with Pb exposure. Results: In 399 men, 858 metabolites were measured and passed QC, of which 154 (17.9%) were significantly associated with blood Pb (p < 0.05). Eleven of these passed stringent correction for multiple testing, including pro-hydroxy-pro (beta(95%CI): 1.52 (0.93,2.12), p = 7.18x10(-7)), N-acetylglycine (beta(95%CI): 1.44 (0.85,2.02), p = 1.12x10(-6)), tartarate (P(95%CI): 0.68 (0.35,1.00), p = 4.84x10(-5)), vanillylmandelate (beta(95%CI): 1.05 (0.47,1.63), p = 4.44x10(-7)), and lysine (beta(95%CI): 1.88 (-2.8,-0.95),p = 9.10x10(-5)). A subset of 48 men had a second blood sample collected a mean of 6.1 years after their first. Three of the top eleven metabolites were also significant in this second blood sample. Furthermore, we identified 70 plasma metabolites associated with Pb as measured in toenails. Twenty-three plasma metabolites were significantly associated with both blood and toenail measures, while others appeared to be specific to the biosample in which Pb was measured. For example, benzanoate metabolism appeared to be of importance with the longer-term exposure assessed by toenails. Discussion: Pb exposure is responsible for 0.6% of the global burden of disease and metabolomics is particularly well-suited to explore its pathogenic mechanisms. In this study, we identified metabolites and metabolomic pathways associated with Pb exposure that suggest that Pb exposure acts through oxidative stress and immune dysfunction. These findings help us to better understand the biology of this important public health burden.

It has been reported that frankincense and myrrh have significant anti-tumor activities. The present study was designed to investigate the inhibitory efficacy of frankincense ethanol extracts (RXC), myrrh ethanol extracts (MYC), frankincense -myrrh ethanol extracts (YDC), frankincense -myrrh water extracts (YDS) and their main compounds on U266 human multiple myeloma cell line. Methods: The inhibition effects of cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT assays. Cell culture supernatant was collected for estimation of cytokines. Western blot analysis was designed to investigate the regulatory of JAK/STAT signal pathway. In addition, cell metabolomics based on the ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF-MS) had been established to investigate the holistic efficacy of frankincense and myrrh on U266 cells. Acquired data were processed by partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal projection to latent structures squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) to identify potential biomarkers. Results: RXC, MYC significantly inhibited the proliferation of U266 cells at dose of 25-400 mu g/mL, YDC and YDS at the dose of 12.5-400 mu g/mL. 3-O-acetyl-a-boswellic acid, 3-acetyl-11 keto-boswellic acid and 11-keto-boswellic acid had the most significant anti-multiple myeloma activities in the 10 compounds investigated, therefore these 3 compounds were selected as representatives for Elisa assay and western blotting experiments. All the extracts and active compounds ameliorated the secretion of cytokines and down-regulated the expression of JAK/STAT signaling pathway-related proteins. Comparing RXC, MYC, YDC and YDS-treated U266 cells with vehicle control (DMSO), 13, 8, 7, 7 distinct metabolites and 2, 2, 3, 0 metabolic target pathways involved in amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, vitamin metabolism, arachidonic acid were identified, respectively. Conclusions: Taken together our results suggest that the frankincense and myrrh and their bioactive compounds inhibit proliferation of U266 multiple myeloma cells by regulating JAK/STAT signaling pathway and cellular metabolic profile.

Aim of the study: A pharmacological investigation of the root methanolic extract (RME) was conducted using the zebrafish epilepsy model to isolate and identify the compounds responsible for a potential antiseizure activity and to provide evidence of its historical use. In addition, a comprehensive metabolite profiling of this studied species was proposed. Materials and methods: The roots were extracted by solvents of increasing polarity and root decoction (RDE) was also prepared. The extracts were evaluated for antiseizure activity using a larval zebrafish epilepsy model with pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures. The RME exhibited the highest antiseizure activity and was therefore selected for bioactivity-guided fractionation. Isolated compounds were fully characterized by NMR and high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS/MS). The UHPLC-HRMS/MS analyses of the RME and RDE were used for dereplication and metabolite profiling. Results: The RME showed 80% inhibition of PTZ-induced locomotor activity (300 mu g/ml). This extract was fractionated and resulted in the isolation of a new glucopyranosyl-deoxyribonolactone (1) and a new furostanol saponin derivative (2), as well as of 20-hydroxyecdysone (3), hellebrin (4), a spirostanol glycoside derivative (5) and deglucohellebrin (6). The antiseizure activity of RME was found to be mainly due to the new furostanol saponin (2) and hellebrin (4), which reduced 45% and 60% of PTZ-induced seizures (135 mu M, respectively). Besides, the aglycone of hellebrin, hellebrigenin (S34), was also active (45% at 7 mu M). To further characterize the chemical composition of both RME and RDE, 30 compounds (A7-33, A35-37) were annotated based on UHPLC-HRMS/MS metabolite profiling. This revealed the presence of additional bufadienolides, furostanols, and evidenced alkaloids. Conclusions: This study is the first to identify the molecular basis of the ethnopharmacological use of black hellebore for the treatment of epilepsy. This was achieved using a microscale zebrafish epilepsy model to rapidly quantify in vivo antiseizure activity. The UHPLC-HRMS/MS profiling revealed the chemical diversity of the extracts and the presence of numerous bufadienolides, furostanols and ecdysteroids, also present in the decoction.

Forty-four volatile metabolites were determined using headspace solid phase microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, including alcohols, esters, organic acids, carbonyl and sulfur compounds. Acetaldehyde, diacetyl, acetoin, acetone, butanoic and acetic acid were present in yogurts in higher intensity, which are the major volatile metabolites related to yogurt flavor. L. paracasei IMC502 did not affect the amounts of acetaldehyde, diacetyl and acetoin while promoted the formation of acetone and butanoic acid. A total of 196 non-volatile metabolites including nucleosides, amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids were analyzed using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS. Non-volatile metabolite profiles of these two types of yogurts were distinguished and 94 differential metabolites were screened using multivariate statistical analysis, which were mainly associated with the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, amino acid metabolism and nucleotide metabolism. The impact of storage on metabolites was also investigated. The amounts of the majority of carbonyl compounds, organic acids and free amino acids increased, while those of acetaldehyde, diacetyl and lactose decreased during storage. This study provides insights into the metabolic mechanism of L. paracasei and represents a real advance in the study of the metabolites in yogurt.

Methods: We employed untargeted, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy metabolomics profiling among 1249 BHS participants (427 African-Americans and 822 whites) with BP and covariable data collected during the 2013 to 2016 visit cycle. A total of 1202 metabolites were tested for associations with continuous and binary BP phenotypes using multiple linear and logistic regression models, respectively, in overall and race-stratified analyses. Results: A total of 24 novel metabolites robustly associated with BP, achieving Bonferroni-correctedPless than 4.16 x 10(-5)in the overall analysis and consistent effect sizes across race groups. The identified metabolites included three amino acid and nucleotide metabolites from histidine, pyrimidine, or tryptophan metabolism sub-pathways, seven cofactor and vitamin or xenobiotic metabolites from the ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, bacterial/fungal, chemical, and food component sub-pathways, 10 lipid metabolites from the eicosanoid, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingolipid metabolism sub-pathways, and four still unnamed metabolites. Six previously described metabolites were robustly confirmed by our study (Bonferroni-correctedP < 4.95 x 10(-4)and consistent effect directions across studies). Furthermore, previously reported metabolites for SBP, DBP, and hypertension demonstrated 5.92-fold, 4.77-fold, and 4.54-fold enrichment for nominally significant signals in the BHS (P = 3.08 x 10(-10), 5.93 x 10(-8), and 2.30 x 10(-8), respectively). Conclusion: In aggregate, our study provides new information about potential molecular mechanisms underlying BP regulation. We also demonstrate reproducibility of findings across studies despite differences in study populations and metabolite profiling methods.

Kun-Ming mice weighing 26 +/- 2 g were used for the hyperglycemia animal model with alloxan and divided into control, hyperglycemia (HG), and HG + SHQ soda water (SHQ) groups. The experiment lasted for 30 days. The plasma metabolomic profiling of mice was determined using ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight-mass spectrometry. After the mice drank SHQ soda water, the levels of insulin and blood glucose were significantly lower in the SHQ group compared with the control group, and the level of insulin sensitivity [insulin sensitivity index (ISI)] was significantly higher in the SHQ group compared with the HG group. The mice in the different groups after SHQ intervention could be separated into distinct clusters, and nine major plasma metabolites with significant differences between groups were found closely associated with blood glucose and ISI. The metabolic pathway analysis of these metabolites involved abnormal fatty acid oxidation and phospholipid, acylcarnitine, and corticoid metabolism. The results suggested the metabolic changes and possible mechanism of SHQ improving the alloxan-induced HG, and the findings provided insights into the prevention and control of HG and diabetes.

Herein, we designed FeOOH@ZIF-8 composites with enhanced ionization efficiency and size-exclusion effect for laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI-MS)-based metabolic diagnosis of gynecological cancers. The FeOOH@ZIF-8-assisted LDI-MS achieved rapid, sensitive, and selective metabolic fingerprints of the native serum without any enrichment or purification.

Aim of the study: This study aimed to address the protective effects of GLJ against KYDS in rats with pharmacodynamic indicators and target tissues (adrenal gland and testis) metabolomics. Materials and methods: The rats were injected intraperitoneally (i.p) hydrocortisone to simulate KYDS and administered orally of GLJ for 30 days. Traditional pharmacodynamic indicators (body weight, behavioral indicators, biochemical parameters and histological examination) were performed to evaluate the efficacy of GLJ. Furthermore, adrenal gland and testis metabolic profiles obtained by UHPLC-Q Exactive Orbitrap-MS coupled with multivariate analysis were conducted to explore the metabolic regulation mechanism of GLJ. Results: After administration of GLJ, the weight, levels of behavioral indicators and biochemical parameters of rats were increased compared with those of the model group, and the abnormalities of morphology in adrenal and testicular tissues were improved. Furthermore, GLJ had recovering effects via the adjustment of vitamins metabolism, which was accompanied by lipids metabolism, amino acid metabolism and nucleotides metabolism. Conclusions: The study firstly integrated the target tissues metabolic profiles, which were complementary, and GLJ had protective effects on KYDS rats via the regulation of steroid hormone biosynthesis, oxidant-antioxidant balance and energy acquisition.

The aim of this work was to study the metabolic profiles of piperine in mouse, rat, dog and human hepatocytes. Methods The biotransformation was carried out by incubating piperine with hepatocytes at 37 degrees C. After incubation for 2 h, the samples were pretreated and analyzed using liquid chromatography combined with diode-array detection and high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC/DAD-HRMS). The structures of the metabolites were assigned through a comparison of their accurate masses and product ions with those of the parent compound. Results A total of 20 metabolites were detected, and the structures were proposed. Piperine was metabolized through the following pathways: (a) oxidation to form a catechol derivative, which further underwent methylation, glucuronidation, glutathione (GSH) conjugation, and hydroxylation followed by opening of the piperidine ring; (b) hydroxylation to form a carbinolamine intermediate followed by opening of the piperidine ring and the formation of alcohol and acid derivatives; and (c) hydroxylation to form stable hydroxylated metabolites. In mouse, the formation of the catechol derivative (M12) and hydroxylation (M11) were the major metabolic pathways; in rat, the formation of the catechol derivative (M12) and glucuronidation (M9) were the main pathways; and in dog and human, the formation of the catechol derivative (M12) was the predominant pathway. No human-specific metabolite was observed. Conclusions This study provided some new information on the metabolic profiles of piperine, which should be of great importance in the study of the pharmacology and toxicity of this compound.

Objective: To investigate whether combined Tc-99m-sestamibi SPECT/CT and in situ metabolomic profiling can accurately characterise renal tumours exhibiting Tc-99m-sestamibi uptake. Design, setting, and participants: A tissue microarray analysis of 33 tumour samples from 28 patients was used to investigate whether their in situ metabolomic status correlates with their features on Tc-99m-sestamibi SPECT/CT examination. In order to validate emerging data, an independent cohort comprising 117 tumours was subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI). Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: MALDI MSI data analysis and image generation were facilitated by FlexImaging v. 4.2, while k-means analysis by SCiLS Lab software followed by R-package CARRoT analysis was used for assessing the highest predictive power in the differential of RO versus chRCC. Heatmap-based clustering, sparse partial least-squares discriminant analysis, and volcano plots were created with MetaboAnalyst 3.0. Results and limitations: We identified a discriminatory metabolomic signature for Tc-99m-sestamibi SPECT/CT-positive Birt-Hogg-Dube-associated HOCTs versus other renal oncocytic tumours. Metabolomic differences were also evident between Tc-99m-sestamibi-positive and Tc-99m-sestamibi-negative chRCCs, prompting additional expert review; two of three Tc-99m-sestamibi-positive chRCCs were reclassified as low-grade oncocytic tumours (LOTs). Differences were identified between distal-derived tumours from those of proximal tubule origin, including differences between ROs and chRCCs. Conclusions: The current study expands the spectrum of Tc-99m-sestamibi SPECT/CT-positive renal tumours, encompassing ROs, HOCTs, LOTs, and chRCCs, and supports the feasibility of in situ metabolomic profiling in the diagnostics and classification of renal tumours. Patient summary: For preoperative evaluation of solid renal tumours, Tc-99m-sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) is a novel examination method. To increase diagnostic accuracy, we propose that Tc-99m-sestamibi-positive renal tumours should be biopsied and followed by a combined histometabolomic analysis. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Therefore we aimed to examine metabolomics profiles in relation to uric acid change and incident hyperuricemia. Methods This study included 1,621 community-dwelling Chinese participants ages 50-70 years without hyperuricemia at baseline, with a mean duration of follow-up of 6 years. A total of 56 metabolites (22 amino acids and 34 acylcarnitines) at baseline were quantified by gas or liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Annual change in uric acid was calculated, and incident hyperuricemia was defined as plasma uric acid >420 mu moles/liter in men and >360 mu moles/liter in women. Results The mean +/- SDannual change in uric acid was 9.6 +/- 12.1 mu moles/liter and the incidence of hyperuricemia was 23.1% (375 of 1,621). After adjustment for conventional risk factors, 9 metabolites (cysteine, glutamine, phenylalanine, threonine, and long-chain acylcarnitines C14:1OH, C18, C18:2, C20, and C20:4) were significantly associated with uric acid change (Bonferroni correctedP< 0.05) and with incident hyperuricemia (relative risks ranged from 1.14 to 1.21 perSDincrement of metabolites;P< 0.05). A network analysis showed significant associations between the module containing long-chain acylcarnitines and incident hyperuricemia. Moreover, levels of these 9 metabolites were specifically correlated with intake of foods, including red and processed meat or soy products. Conclusion Plasma cysteine, glutamine, phenylalanine, threonine, and long-chain acylcarnitines are positively associated with incident hyperuricemia. The levels of these metabolites may be partially driven by intakes of meat and soy products that are associated with hyperuricemia.

However, longitudinal biopsy of brain parenchyma is difficult due to its critical location, whereas cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be obtained serially with a little invasiveness of puncture. Thus, if we could find a biomarker for glioma progression, we could predict such event and determine therapeutic interventions as early as possible. In this study, we examined whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metabolome profiles can reflect glioma grade, difference with non-glial tumor, and LM status. We selected 32 CSF samples from glioma patients, and compared them with 10 non-tumor control and seven non-glial brain tumor (medulloblastoma) samples. A total of 10,408 low-mass ions (LMIs) were detected as a candidate of metabolites using mass spectrometry, and representative LMIs were identified via the Human Metabolome Database. Grade IV gliomas showed eight LMIs, including acetic acid, of higher levels (summed sensitivity and specificity > 180%) than grade III gliomas. Grade IV gliomas demonstrated more abundant 30 LMIs, including glycerophosphate, compared with medulloblastoma, but none was mutually exclusive. Phospholipid derivatives were significantly more abundant in LM (-) than LM (+) gliomas regardless of glioma grade. LMIs representative of LM (+) gliomas were derivatives of glycolysis. We also verified discriminative LMIs based on mean expression level of each LMI (Studentttest,p< 0.05) and evaluated the differences of the above analyses. Over 90% of metabolite pathways indicated from two analytical models were common to each other. Non-targeted mass spectrometry of CSF metabolites revealed significantly different profiles across gliomas that possibly permitted differentiation between glioma grades, LM, and non-glial brain tumors.

Methods: The various hydroethanolic extracts of Conocarpus lancifolius leaf were prepared by ultrasonication assisted freeze- drying. Total phenolic contents, flavonoid contents, antioxidant activity, alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase inhibitions of leaf extracts were determined. The metabolite profiling was accomplished by UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis. The antidiabetic assessment of the most potent extract was carried out by measuring the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effect in the high fat diet-fed diabetic albino mice. The blood glucose level, haemoglobin, total cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) were determined. Results: The 60% ethanolic extract exhibited the highest phenolic and flavonoid contents of (349.39 +/- 2.13) mg GAE/g dry extract and (116.95 +/- 2.34) mg RE/g dry extracts, respectively, and the highest DPPH scavenging activity with an IC50 value of (32.87 +/- 1.11) mu g/ mL. The IC50 values for alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase inhibitions were (38.64 +/- 0.93) mu g/mL and (44.80 +/- 1.57) mu g/mL, respectively. UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis confirmed the presence of gallic acid, ellagic acid, corilagin, kaempherol-3-O-rutinoside, caffeic acid derivative, isorhamnetin and galloyl derivatives in the 60% ethanolic extract. Plant extract at a dose of 450 mg/kg body weight reduced blood glucose level, total cholesterol, LDL and HDL, and increased haemoglobin in alloxan-induced diabetic mice, Conclusions: Conocarpus lancifolius leaves are proved as a good source of biologically functional metabolites and possess antidiabetic activity which may be further explored to treat diabetes.

Ultrasound-assisted extraction with methanol was used to hair extraction, while solid-phase extraction (SPE) was applied to urine and blood (plasma) samples. Liquid chromatography-high field quadrupole exactive orbitrap mass spectrometer (LC-Q Exactive HF MS) was then applied to analyze the extracts. Full-scan positive ion mode and the targeted MS/MS strategies were firstly employed to obtain precise mass measurements. Seventeen metabolites, including 14 phase I and 3 phase II metabolites, were characterized and preliminarily identified. In addition to methcathinone and cathinone, 15 unreported metabolites were identified initially. Six metabolic pathways, including demethylation, ketone reduction, glucuronidation, hydroxylation, acetylation and sulphation were also illuminated in this work, containing five novel metabolic pathways of methcathinone. Although methcathinone and cathinone are widely considered to be the primary biomarker, they were not detected in blood (plasma) samples. By comparing the contents and metabolic time points of these metabolites in different biological samples, it was determined that urine samples can serve as the preferred biological material for identifying methcathinone misuse. M4 (Demethylation + monohydroxlyation) was detected in all the biological samples, suggesting that it can potentially act as a new biomarker for monitoring methcathinone abuse.

A percentage of hypertensive patients develop albuminuria despite being under chronic suppression of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). We previously identified urinary metabolites associated with the development of albuminuria. In this study, we searched for metabolic alterations which reflect different levels within the condition of normoalbuminuria. Patients, materials and methods: Urine from 48 hypertensive patients under chronic RAS suppression was analysed. They were classified according to the albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) into 3 groups: Normoalbuminuria (<10 mg/g); high-normal (10-30 mg/g in men, or 20-40 mg/g in women); and moderately high albuminuria (microalbuminuria, 30-200 mg/g or 40-300 mg/g, respectively). The metabolome was analysed by mass spectrometry and a correlation analysis was performed between altered metabolite levels and ACR. Results: Oxaloacetate, 3-ureidopropionate, guanidoacetate and malate show significant variation between the normo and micro groups. Additionally, these metabolites are able to differentiate between patients in the normo and high-normal range. A significant correlation between metabolites and ACR was found. Observed variations point to alterations in the energy metabolism already in patients with albuminuria in the high-normal range. Conclusions: The association between the molecular panel consisting of 3-ureidopropionate, oxaloacetate, malate and guanidoacetate and different levels of albuminuria is confirmed. A metabolic fingerprint was also identified showing variations within the condition of nor-moalbuminuria allowing an earlier molecular stratification of patients.

Its oil, the M. cajuputi essential oil (MCEO), has been utilized as the main flavor of the Indonesian functional food, Cajuputs Candy. However, the availability of MCEO is becoming limited. On the other hand, Indonesia has many other potential MCEO sources which can be developed as flavor ingredient. Thus, it is noteworthy to explore these new MCEO sources by studying their sensory characteristics and metabolite profiles. This study was conducted to identify potential metabolites that are correlated to sensory attributes of MCEO by using the metabolomics approach. The metabolite profiles of thirteen MCEOs from different origins were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry while sensory analyses on Cajuputs Candy were conducted by difference-from-control and rate-all-that-apply tests. Sixty metabolites from the MCEO were annotated that includes 1,8-cineole, alpha-terpineol, caryophyllene, alpha-pinene, and gamma-terpinene. Sensory analysis revealed cooling aftertaste and sweet taste as favorable attributes. Further analysis using Orthogonal Partial Least Square indicated that 1,8-cineole and gamma-terpinene were correlated with cooling aftertaste, while 1,8-cineole and caryophyllene were also correlated with sweet taste. In contrast, linalool and nerolidol were associated with the feature of the most characteristic manufacturer's products which have unfavorable attributes such as floral, iodophor-like, metallic, and soapy attributes. The identification of these metabolites will be useful for the selection of MCEOs that can potentially be used as flavor. (C) 2019, The Society for Biotechnology, Japan. All rights reserved.

Different plants exhibit diverse defense mechanisms through which various important metabolites are synthesized. Humans can exploit these mechanisms to improve the efficacy of existing drugs and to develop new ones. Most previous studies have focused on the effects of wounding stress on the different plant parts, such as leaves, stems, and roots. To date, however, no study has investigated the accumulation of primary and galantamine content following the exposure of a callus to wounding stress. Therefore, in the present study, we exposed Lycoris radiata calli to wounding stress and assessed the expression levels of several genes involved in metabolic pathways at various time points (0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h of exposure). Furthermore, we quantify the primary and galantamine content using gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry and the high-performance liquid chromatography qRT-PCR analysis of eight galantamine pathway genes (LrPAL-2, LrPAL-3, LrC4H-2, LrC3H, LrTYDC2, LrN4OMT, LrNNR, and LrCYP96T) revealed that seven genes, except LrN4OMT, were significantly expressed following exposure to wounding stress. Galantamine contents of calli after 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h of exposure were respectively 2.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3.5, 5.0, 5.0, and 8.5 times higher than that after 0 h of exposure. Furthermore, a total of 48 hydrophilic metabolites were detected in the 0 h exposed callus and 96 h exposed callus using GC-TOFMS. In particular, a strong positive correlation between galantamine and initial precursors, such as phenylalanine and tyrosine, was observed.

The plant parts (leaves, branches, and barks) are widely used in folk medicine. However, they are little explored in terms of chemical composition. In this study, the polar extracts of leaves, branches, and barks of the species were analysed by direct infusion in ESI-MS with the aid of reference standards and MS 2 fragmentation experiments. Twenty-six substances (carboxylic acids, flavonoids, condensed tannins. a diterpene and fifteen isomers of galoylquinic acids) were detected. Metabolic profiles were similar between extracts of leaves and branches. especially with the detection of galloylquinic acids and carboxylic acids. In bark extract, condensed tannins epicatechin(4 beta-8)-epiafzelechin (dimer) and epicatechin-(4 beta-8)-epiafzelechin-(4 beta-8)-epiafzelechin (trimer) were detected. The PCA showed differences and similarities in the chemical composition of the copafba mari-mari extracts. Thus, galloylquinic acids and flavonoids kaempferol, 7-O-methyl-kaempferol, quercetin-3-O-L-pentoside, and quercetin-3-O-L-rhamnoside are described for the first time in C. multijuga. The phytotherapeutic properties of teas of the plant parts of the species may be associated with the suggested polyphenols.

The objectives of our study were to determine the different metabolites in the Cyperus conglomeratus Rottb. methanol extract, and to assess its in vivo gastroprotective effect in ethanol-induced gastric ulcer model in rats. Serum levels of galactin-3 and TNF-alpha were employed as biochemical markers. To pinpoint for active agents, comprehensive metabolites profiling of extract via UPLC-qTOF-MS/MS was employed. A total of 77 chromatographic peaks were detected, of which 70 were annotated. The detected metabolites were categorized into phenolic acids and their derivatives, flavonoids, stilbenes, aurones, quinones, terpenes, and steroids. Rats were divided into six groups; healthy control, ulcer control, standard drug group, and 25, 50, 100 mg/kg of C. conglomeratus treated rats. Pre-treatment with C. conglomeratus alcohol extract significantly reduced galactin-3, and TNF-alpha in ethanol-induced ulcer model at 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg. Further histopathological and histochemical studies revealed moderate erosion of superficial epithelium, few infiltrated inflammatory cells, and depletion of gastric tissue glycoprotein in the ulcer group. Treatment with the extract protected the gastric epithelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. It could be concluded that C. conglomeratus extract provides significant gastroprotective activity in ethanol-induced gastric ulcer and ought to be included in nutraceuticals in the future for ulcer treatment.

Pre-diagnostic biomarkers of type 2 diabetes identified in the UAE's obese national population using targeted metabolomics	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							METABOLITE PROFILES; PLASMA; CARNITINE; METFORMIN; MELLITUS	Currently, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity are major global public health issues, and their prevalence in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are among the highest in the world. In 2019, The UAE diabetes national prevalence was 15.4%. In recent years there has been a considerable investigation of predictive biomarkers associated with these conditions. This study analysed fasting (8 h) blood samples from an obese, normoglycemic cohort and an obese, T2DM cohort of UAE nationals, employing clinical chemistry analysis, 1D H-1 NMR and mass spectroscopy (FIA-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS) techniques. The novel findings reported for the first time in a UAE population revealed significant differences in a number of metabolites in the T2DM cohort. Metabolic fingerprints identified by NMR included BCAAs, trimethylamine N-oxide, beta -hydroxybutyrate, trimethyl uric acid, and alanine. A targeted MS approach showed significant differences in lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines, acylcarnitine, amino acids and sphingomyelins; Lyso.PC.a.C18.0, PC.ae.C34.2, C3.DC..C4.OH, glutamine and SM.C16.1, being the most significant metabolites. Pearson's correlation studies showed associations between these metabolites and the clinical chemistry parameters across both cohorts. This report identified differences in metabolites in response to T2DM in agreement with many published population studies. This contributes to the global search for a bank of metabolite biomarkers that can predict the advent of T2DM and give insight to its pathogenic mechanisms.

Study Design: Analysis of serum samples obtained prior to cardiopulmonary bypass from 82 infants <= 120 days old with congenital heart disease requiring surgery at Children's Hospital Colorado. Infants were divided into groups based on pre-operative oxygen saturations: non-hypoxemic (>92%), mild hypoxemia (85-92%), and severe hypoxemia (<85%). Tandem mass spectrometry was used to analyze 165 targeted metabolites. Partial least squares discriminant analysis and t-tests were used to determine differences among metabolic profiles and individual metabolites respectively. Results: The broad metabolic fingerprint of neonates or older infants did not vary by degree of hypoxemia. There were 12 individual metabolites that differed between hypoxemic and non-hypoxemic neonates, including lower methylmalonic acid (p = 2.44 x 10(-4)), glutamate (p = 0.001), and hypoxanthine (p = 0.003), and higher thymine (p = 8.67 x 10(-4)) and myo- inositol (p = 0.014) seen in hypoxemic neonates. Individual metabolites did not vary significantly between older infants with or without hypoxemia. Conclusions: We did not find evidence supporting global metabolic changes associated with cyanotic congenital heart disease in neonates or older infants. However, specific metabolites did discriminate between hypoxemic and non-hypoxemic neonates. These include methylmalonic acid, as well as several metabolites known to change in hypoxia-reoxygenation states (hypoxanthine) and chronic hypoxemic states (glutamate, thymine, myo-inositol) and may represent specific metabolic changes triggered by hypoxemia among neonates with cyanotic congenital heart disease.

Metabolomic profile of cancer stem cell-derived exosomes from patients with malignant melanoma	MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY			English	Article						biomarkers; cancer stem cells; exosomes; malignant melanoma; metabolomics	HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA; THERAPEUTIC TARGET; TUMOR; BIOMARKERS; PLASMA; MICROVESICLES; REVEALS; DISEASE	Malignant melanoma (MM) is the most aggressive and life-threatening form of skin cancer. It is characterized by an extraordinary metastasis capacity and chemotherapy resistance, mainly due to melanoma cancer stem cells (CSCs). To date, there are no suitable clinical diagnostic, prognostic or predictive biomarkers for this neoplasia. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new MM biomarkers that enable early diagnosis and effective disease monitoring. Exosomes represent a novel source of biomarkers since they can be easily isolated from different body fluids. In this work, a primary patient-derived MM cell line enriched in CSCs was characterized by assessing the expression of specific markers and their stem-like properties. Exosomes derived from CSCs and serums from patients with MM were characterized, and their metabolomic profile was analysed by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) following an untargeted approach and applying univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. The aim of this study was to search potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of this disease. Our results showed significant metabolomic differences in exosomes derived from MM CSCs compared with those from differentiated tumour cells and also in serum-derived exosomes from patients with MM compared to those from healthy controls. Interestingly, we identified similarities between structural lipids differentially expressed in CSC-derived exosomes and those derived from patients with MM such as the glycerophosphocholine PC 16:0/0:0. To our knowledge, this is the first metabolomic-based study aimed at characterizing exosomes derived from melanoma CSCs and patients' serum in order to identify potential biomarkers for MM diagnosis. We conclude that metabolomic characterization of CSC-derived exosomes sets an open door to the discovery of clinically useful biomarkers in this neoplasia.

We aimed to test whether maternal postpartum metabolomic profiles, especially CVD-related metabolites, varied according to PTD subtypes with and without preeclampsia, in a US urban, low-income multi-ethnic population. Methods This study, from the Boston Birth Cohort, included 980 women with term delivery, 79 with medically indicated PTD (mPTD) and preeclampsia, 52 with mPTD only, and 219 with spontaneous PTD (sPTD). Metabolomic profiling in postpartum plasma was conducted by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Linear regression models were used to assess the associations of each metabolite with mPTD with preeclampsia, mPTD only, and sPTD, respectively, adjusting for pertinent covariates. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis was applied to investigate interconnected metabolites associated with the PTD/preeclampsia subgroups. Bonferroni correction was applied to account for multiple testing. Results A total of 380 known metabolites were analyzed. Compared to term controls, women with mPTD and preeclampsia showed a significant increase in 36 metabolites, mainly representing acylcarnitines and multiple classes of lipids (diacylglycerols, triacylglycerols, phosphocholines, and lysophosphocholines), as well as a decrease in 11 metabolites including nucleotides, steroids, and cholesteryl esters (CEs) (P < 1.3 x 10(-4)). Alterations of diacylglycerols, triacylglycerols, and CEs in women with mPTD and preeclampsia remained significant when compared to women with mPTD only. In contrast, the metabolite differences between women with mPTD only and term controls were only seen in phosphatidylethanolamine class. Women with sPTD had significantly different levels of 16 metabolites mainly in amino acid, nucleotide, and steroid classes compared to term controls, of which, anthranilic acid, bilirubin, and steroids also had shared associations in women with mPTD and preeclampsia. Conclusion In this sample of US high-risk women, PTD/preeclampsia subgroups each showed some unique and shared associations with maternal postpartum plasma metabolites, including those known to be predictors of future CVD. These findings, if validated, may provide new insight into metabolomic alterations underlying clinically observed PTD/preeclampsia subgroups and implications for women's future cardiometabolic health.

Using support vector machine algorithm, three models for ovarian tumors diagnosis, benign-malignant distinguishing, early diagnosis and borderline-malignant distinguishing were developed. These models have good classification performance and provided a novel insight for non-invasive diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Diagnosis of ovarian cancer is difficult due to the lack of clinical symptoms and effective screening algorithms. In this study, we aim to develop models for ovarian cancer diagnosis by detecting metabolites in urine and plasma samples. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS) in positive ion mode was used for metabolome quantification in 235 urine samples and 331 plasma samples. Then, Urine and plasma metabolomic profiles were analyzed by univariate and multivariate statistics. Four groups of samples: normal control, benign, borderline and malignant ovarian tumors were enrolled in this study. A total of 1330 features and 1302 features were detected from urine and plasma samples respectively. Based on two urine putative metabolites, five plasma putative metabolites and five urine putative metabolites, three models for distinguishing normal-ovarian tumors, benign-malignant (borderline + malignant) and borderline-malignant ovarian tumors were developed respectively. The AUC (Area Under Curve) values were 0.987, 0876 and 0.943 in discovery set and 0.984, 0.896 and 0.836 in validation set for three models. Specially, the diagnostic model based on 5 plasma putative metabolites had better early-stage diagnosis performance than CA125 alone. The AUC values of the model were 0.847 and 0.988 in discovery and validation set respectively. Our results showed that normal and ovarian tumors have unique metabolic signature in urine and plasma samples, which shed light on the ovarian cancer diagnosis and classification.

Unfortunately, excessive GCs can induce many side effects associated with disordered fatty acid (FA) metabolism. Although an increased level of total FA has been found after GCs treatment, it is not clear whether all FA species increased or only certain FA species were altered. A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based FA profiling approach was performed to reveal the alterations of FA species in SLE model mice (MRL/lpr) after treatment with 5 mg/kg of prednisone. The study showed a distinct FA profile in MRL/lpr mice compared to the controls, mainly manifested by elevated polyunsaturated FAs (arachidonate, docosahexaenoate, etc.), which are related to the inflammatory state; and altered (product FA/precursor FA) ratios representing the estimated activities of FA desaturase and elongase (higher activities of multiple elongases, o4 desaturase, o5 desaturase, o6 desaturase, and lower activity of o8 desaturase). Treatment with 5 mg/kg of prednisone decreased the total level of n-6 polyunsaturated FA in MRL/lpr mice; in particular, the level of arachidonate and estimated activity of o5 desaturase were reduced to the control level. Moreover, prednisone induced additional perturbations in FAs, including not only saturated FAs, but also monounsaturated FAs and n-3 polyunsaturated FAs, indicating that there was a strong effect of prednisone on FA metabolism. These results may be valuable for further studies of the side effects of GCs treatment.

However, its metabolic characteristics remains to be explored, especially in humans. The current study aimed to identify major metabolites and specific metabolizing enzymes involved in bicyclol metabolism in vitro and in vivo using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with Q-Exactive orbitrap mass spectrometry (HPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap/MS). After incubation with liver microsomes and oral administration to rats, dogs and humans, a total of nine metabolites of bicyclol were identified including M1 (methyl ester hydrolysate product), M2-M3 (demethylated bicyclol), M4-M5 (demethoxy or dehydroxymethyl bicyclol), M6 (glucuronidated bicyclol) and M7-M9 (glucuronide conjugates of metabolites). Among these metabolites, M2 and M3 were the major phase I metabolites mainly mediated by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, while M6 was the dominant phase II metabolite primarily catalyzed by UGT2B4. In this study, species-related metabolic difference among rats, dogs and humans were observed. In humans and dogs, M6 (glucuronidated bicyclol) was the most abundant circulating metabolite (higher than the parent drug) in the blood after oral administration, while the parent drug was the highest in rats. M4 and M5 were rats-specific metabolites whereas M1 and M9 were absent in dogs in vivo. The metabolism of bicyclol was demonstrated as demethylation and glucuronidation mediated by multiple drug metabolizing enzymes in different species. Our findings systematically elucidated the metabolic sites and routes of bicyclol in human for the first time, which may be helpful for rational combined application in clinic and further study of metabolites-related efficacy or toxicity.

Phase I metabolic profiling and unexpected reactive metabolites in human liver microsome incubations of X-376 using LC-MS/MS: bioactivation pathway elucidation and in silico toxicity studies of its metabolites	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							LUNG-CANCER IMPLICATIONS; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; IDENTIFICATION; IMINIUM	X-376 is a novel new generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor that can cross the blood brain barrier, so it can be used in patients with both ALK-positive NSCLC with CNS metastases. In this study, X-376 was incubated with human liver microsomes, and in vitro phase-I metabolic reactions were performed to generate X-376 reactive intermediates, which cannot be detected directly as they are unstable. Utilizing LC-MS/MS, we characterized X-376 metabolites and checked for the reactive electrophile generation using nucleophilic trapping agents, namely, potassium cyanide and GSH, which form stable adducts for characterization by mass spectrometry. Four X-376 phase-I metabolites and three reactive intermediates (one quinone methide and two iminium ions) were characterized and the bioactivation pathways were proposed. X-376 bioactivation occurred through unexpected novel pathways. Although the pyridazine ring was found to be bioactivated, no bioactivation was detected in the expected N-methyl piperazine ring that is often found for similar structures. The dichloro-phenyl group was bioactivated by a novel mechanism that was verified by LC-MS/MS. We propose that the X-376 reported side effects may be due to the formation of reactive metabolites. The in silico toxicity assessment of X-376 metabolites was carried out using DEREK software and structural modification were proposed to reduce their side effects and to validate the bioactivation pathway theory using StarDrop DEREK module. Further drug discovery studies can be done according to this concept, thus allowing the development of new drugs with more safety profile that was confirmed by using StarDrop software. To our knowledge, this is the first study of in vitro metabolic profiling or structural characterization and toxicological properties of the generated metabolites for X-376.

In this experiment, a comprehensive qualification and quantification of phenolic metabolites in eight organs of pecan were conducted for the first time. Ninety-seven phenolic metabolites were identified, in which twelve were identified for the first time in pecan, including a series of ellagitannins with high molecular weight. Hydrolysable tannin was the dominant kind of phenolic metabolites in pecan. The metabolic profiles of tannins in pecan were extended. Thirty-three phenolic metabolites were quantified, among them the highest content was ellagic acid pentose in testa. From this experiment, we can see that the distribution of phenolic metabolites in pecan was organ-specific, tannins tend to accumulate in pecan testa with both diverse structures and high contents, while flavonols tend to accumulate in organs such as branch, bark, or leaf. Among all organs, testa contained the highest content of phenolics, which might play important roles in protecting pecan kernel from diseases and insects. A massive phenolic metabolites' matrix in different pecan organs was built in this experiment, which should be useful for related researches in the future and help provide a theoretical basis for using these organs as functional foods.

Metabolic dysfunction represents a core feature of AD and cognitive impairment, but few metabolomic studies have focused on cognitive aging in midlife. Using an untargeted metabolomics approach, we identified metabolic predictors of cognitive aging in midlife using fasting plasma sample from 30 middle-aged (mean age 57.2), male-male twin pairs enrolled in the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (VETSA). For all twin pairs, one twin developed incident MCI, whereas his co-twin brother remained to be cognitively normal during an average 5.5-year follow-up. Linear mixed model was used to identify metabolites predictive of MCI conversion or cognitive change over time, adjusting for traditional risk factors. Results from twins were replicated in an independent cohort of middle-aged adults (mean age 59.1) in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP). Results in twins showed that higher baseline levels of four plasma metabolites, including sphingomyelin (d18:1/20:1 and d18:2/20:0), sphingomyelin (d18:1/22:1, d18:2/22:0, and d16:1/24:1), DAG (18:2/20:4), and hydroxy-CMPF, were significantly associated with a slower decrease in one or more domains of cognitive function. The association of sphingomyelin (d18:1/20:1 and d18:2/20:0) was replicated in WRAP. Our results support that metabolic perturbation occurs many years before cognitive impairment and plasma metabolites may serve as early biomarkers for prediction or monitoring of cognitive aging and AD in midlife.

Methods: We applied a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics platform to EDTA-plasma to measure 470 metabolites at baseline in a discovery set of 943 postmenopausal women (including 417 incident deaths, median time to death of 10.6 years) with validation in an independent set of 1355 postmenopausal women (including 685 deaths, median time to death of 9.1 years) in the Women's Health Initiative. Results: Eight new metabolites were discovered to be associated with all-cause mortality. Findings included protective effects of increased levels of three amino acids (asparagine, homoarginine and tryptophan) and docosatrienoic acid; and detrimental effects of increased levels of C4-OH-carnitine, hexadecanedioate and two purine/pyrimidines (N2, N2-dimethylguanosine and N4-acetylcytidine). In addition, a set of nine previously published metabolite associations were replicated. A metabolite score comprising 17 metabolites was associated with mortality (P< 10(-8) ) after adjustment for risk factors, with a hazard ratio of 1.95 (95% CI: 1.46-2.62) for women in the highest quartile compared with the lowest quartile of metabolite score. The score was robust among younger women and older women, for both cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality, and associated with both early deaths (within the first 10 years of baseline) and later deaths. Conclusions: Our study fills a gap in the literature by identifying eight novel metabolite associations with all-cause mortality in women, using a robust study design involving independent discovery and validation datasets.

Metabolic dysregulation in the Atp7b(-/-) Wilson's disease mouse model	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						nuclear receptors; liver; copper	ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASE; COPPER TRANSPORTER ATP7B; FATTY LIVER; UNCOUPLING PROTEIN-2; X RECEPTOR; PEPCK-M; EXPRESSION; OBESITY; ACCUMULATION; MANIFESTATION	Inactivating mutations in the copper transporter Atp7b result in Wilson's disease. The Atp7b(-/-) mouse develops hallmarks of Wilson's disease. The activity of several nuclear receptors decreased in Atp7b(-/-) mice, and nuclear receptors are critical for maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Therefore, we anticipated that Atp7b(-/-)mice would exhibit altered progression of diet-induced obesity, fatty liver, and insulin resistance. Following 10 wk on a chow or Western-type diet (40% kcal fat), parameters of glucose and lipid homeostasis were measured. Hepatic metabolites were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and correlated with transcriptomic data. Atp7b(-/-) mice fed a chow diet presented with blunted body-weight gain over time, had lower fat mass, and were more glucose tolerant than wild type (WT) littermate controls. On the Western diet, Atp7b(-/-) mice exhibited reduced body weight, adiposity, and hepatic steatosis compared with WT controls. Atp7b(-/-) mice fed either diet were more insulin sensitive than WT controls; however, fasted Atp7b(-/-) mice exhibited hypoglycemia after administration of insulin due to an impaired glucose counter-regulatory response, as evidenced by reduced hepatic glucose production. Coupling gene expression with metabolomic analyses, we observed striking changes in hepatic metabolic profiles in Atp7b(-/-) mice, including increases in glycolytic intermediates and components of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In addition, the active phosphorylated form of AMP kinase was significantly increased in Atp7b(-/-) mice relative to WT controls. Alterations in hepatic metabolic profiles and nuclear receptor signaling were associated with improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity as well as with impaired fasting glucose production in Atp7b(-/-) mice.

Hegi) is a multi-year species rich in various classes of phytochemicals with known nutritional and pharmacological properties, such as polyphenols, sesquiterpene lactones, and terpenoids. Over the last decade, hybrids cultivars are transforming the artichoke market for their higher uniformity and stability over the traditional landraces, further increasing the potential of the artichoke as a source of commercial extracts and bioactive molecules. Our aim was to investigate the mineral and phytochemical profiles of leaves from seven seed-propagated hybrids by using an untargeted metabolomic approach based on ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Metabolomics identified several compounds in the tested varieties, namely 98 polyphenols, 123 sesquiterpene lactones, and 221 other metabolites. The phenolic content ranged from 3.01 mg Eq./g fw (for 'Opera') to 4.71 mg Eq./g fw (for 'Opal'). Sesquiterpene lactones were, on average, 2.11 mg Eq./g fw. Multivariate statistics (HCA, PCA and OPLS-DA) highlighted the main metabolomics differences among cultivars, which weakly correlated with their agronomic classification. The seven cultivars showed distinctive metabolomics profiles, with 'Opal' and 'Istar' being the most valuable hybrids. The 3-hydroxyphenyl-valeric acid (a medium-chain fatty acid) and the 6-Gingesulfonic acid (a methoxyphenol) were the most discriminant markers. Our findings illustrated the quantitative and qualitative variation of several classes of phytochemicals in seed-propagated artichoke cultivars and allowed identifying distinctive metabolic signatures for both phenolic compounds and sesquiterpene lactones. This work supports the exploitation of the artichoke leaves from hybrid cultivars as a rich source of bioactive phytochemicals.

Profiling of Altered Metabolomic States in Bidens pilosa Leaves in Response to Treatment by Methyl Jasmonate and Methyl Salicylate	PLANTS-BASEL			English	Article						Bidens pilosa; caftaric acid; chicoric acid; caffeoylquinic acid; chlorogenic acid; flavonoids; metabolomic profiling; methyl jasmonate; methyl salicylate; phytohormones	SECONDARY METABOLITES; CHLOROGENIC ACID; CHICORIC ACID; IDENTIFICATION; METABOANALYST; ANTIOXIDANT; FLAVONOIDS; RESISTANCE; PATHWAYS; DEFENSES	Bidens pilosa (Asteraceae) is an edible medicinal plant with many bioactivities reported to have a health-beneficial role in controling various diseases. Though B. pilosa contain a diverse array of natural products, these are produced in relatively low concentrations. A possible way to enhance secondary metabolite production can be through the use of elicitors. Here, the effects of exogenous treatments with two signal molecules-methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and methyl salicylate (MeSA)-on the metabolomic profiles of B. pilosa leaves were investigated. Plants were treated with 0.5 mM of MeJA or MeSA and harvested at 12 h and 24 h. Metabolites were extracted with methanol and separated on an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography system hyphenated to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry detection. Data was subjected to multivariate statistical analysis and modeling for annotation of metabolites. Hydroxycinnamic acid (HCA) derivatives, such as caffeoylquinic acids (CQAs), tartaric acid esters (chicoric acid and caftaric acid), chalcones, and flavonoids were identified as differentially regulated. The altered metabolomes in response to MeSA and MeJA overlapped to a certain extent, suggestive of a cross-talk between signaling and metabolic pathway activation. Moreover, the perturbation of isomeric molecules, especially the cis geometrical isomers of HCA derivatives by both treatments, further point to the biological significance of these molecules during physiological responses to stress. The results highlight the possibility of using phytohormones to enhance the accumulation of bioactive secondary metabolites in this plant.

Mid-gestation serum lipidomic profile associations with spontaneous preterm birth are influenced by body mass index	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASES; INFLAMMATION; OBESITY; PLASMA; IDENTIFICATION; OXYLIPINS; ACIDS; RISK; F-2-ISOPROSTANES; SUPPLEMENTATION	Spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) is a major cause of infant morbidity and mortality. While metabolic changes leading to preterm birth are unknown, several factors including dyslipidemia and inflammation have been implicated and paradoxically both low (<18.5 kg/m(2)) and high (>30 kg/m(2)) body mass indices (BMIs) are risk factors for this condition. The objective of the study was to identify BMI-associated metabolic perturbations and potential mid-gestation serum biomarkers of preterm birth in a cohort of underweight, normal weight and obese women experiencing either sPTB or full-term deliveries (n = 102; n = 17/group). For this purpose, we combined untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics with targeted metabolic profiling of major regulators of inflammation and metabolism, including oxylipins, endocannabinoids, bile acids and ceramides. Women who were obese and had sPTB showed elevated oxidative stress and dyslipidemia characterized by elevated serum free fatty acids. Women who were underweight-associated sPTB also showed evidence of dyslipidemia characterized by elevated phospholipids, unsaturated triglycerides, sphingomyelins, cholesteryl esters and long-chain acylcarnitines. In normal weight women experiencing sPTB, the relative abundance of 14(15)-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid and 14,15-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids to other regioisomers were altered at mid-pregnancy. This phenomenon is not yet associated with any biological process, but may be linked to estrogen metabolism. These changes were differentially modulated across BMI groups. In conclusion, using metabolomics we observed distinct BMI-dependent metabolic manifestations among women who had sPTB. These observations suggest the potential to predict sPTB mid-gestation using a new set of metabolomic markers and BMI stratification. This study opens the door to further investigate the role of cytochrome P450/epoxide hydrolase metabolism in sPTB.

In this study, profiling of organic acids in honey is carried out by sequential liquid-liquid extraction assisted isotope labeling-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 493 potential organic acids are detected in honey, and 165 of those are confirmed by comparing with authentic standards and interpretation of obtained MSn spectra. Findings from this study further expand our understanding about the number of organic acids in honey, increasing from 120 (previously reported) to 258. Moreover, we find that the composition of organic acids detected in rape, acacia and Chinese astragalus honey is quite similar; but their contents show certain variations. This study provides basic knowledge about the number and nature of organic acids in honey and could be stepping stone to explore the link between organic acids and nutritional and medicinal characteristics of honey.

However, in vitro culture expansion of hMSCs induces a rapid decline of stem cell properties through replicative senescence. Here, we characterize metabolic profiles of hMSCs during expansion. We show that alterations of cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+/NADH) redox balance and activity of the Sirtuin (Sirt) family enzymes regulate cellular senescence of hMSCs. Treatment with NAD+precursor nicotinamide increases the intracellular NAD+level and re-balances the NAD+/NADH ratio, with enhanced Sirt-1 activity in hMSCs at high passage, partially restores mitochondrial fitness and rejuvenates senescent hMSCs. By contrast, human fibroblasts exhibit limited senescence as their cellular NAD+/NADH balance is comparatively stable during expansion. These results indicate a potential metabolic and redox connection to replicative senescence in adult stem cells and identify NAD+as a metabolic regulator that distinguishes stem cells from mature cells. This study also suggests potential strategies to maintain cellular homeostasis of hMSCs in clinical applications. Yuan et al. characterise metabolic profiles of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) during cell expansion in culture. They find that late passage hMSCs exhibit a NAD+/NADH redox cycle imbalance and that adding NAD+precursor nicotinamide restores mitochondrial fitness and cellular homeostasis in senescent hMSCs indicating a possible route to preserve hMSC homeostasis for therapeutic use.

Acerola cherry (Malpighia emarginata D.C.) is a tropical fruit of great economic and nutritional value due to its high content of vitamin C. However, there is little information available about which ripening stage of Acerola cherry can provide the best nutrients. In the current study, the chemical variation at two developmental stages (immature and mature) were investigated by metabolic profiling, and the biological properties of Acerola cherry and its antioxidant assays at four developmental stages were measured, respectively. Through comprehensive metabolites analysis via ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry system (UPLC-QTOF), 1896 annotated metabolite features were obtained, and 133 metabolites were finally identified according to the MS/MS fragments compared with these standards in in-house database. Statistically differences in the levels of amino acids, flavonoids, lipids, terpenoids and ascorbic acids were found between mature and immature fruits. Interestingly, most of differential accumulated amino acids, flavonoids, lipids, and terpenoids predominantly accumulated in the mature fruits and ascorbic acid predominantly accumulated in the immature fruits. On the other hand, their antioxidant activities were compared. The alcoholic extract of immature acerola fruit possessed better scavenging ability of DPPH and ABTS than the mature one. The well correlations were found between the antioxidant potential with its content of ascorbic acid (r = 0.9803 and 0.9897, respectively). In conclusion, Acerola cherry showed very different metabolite profile and antioxidant activities during the fruit ripening development. The maturity of Acerola cherry has to be considered when it is being used for health food products.

A targeted metabolomic profiling of plasma acylcarnitines in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease	EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; Metabolic syndrome; Metabolomic profiling; Acylcarnitine		OBJECTIVE: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a common liver disorder caused by lipid accumulation and insulin resistance (IR). Acylcarnitines have become a new biomarker of IR. However, their roles in NAFLD are still poorly studied. Thus, we performed a targeted metabolomic analysis to study the level of plasma acylcarnitines in patients with NAFLD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The levels of 34 plasma acylcarnitines were measured by a targeted metabolomic approach in NAFLD patients (n = 50) and in healthy control subjects (n = 50) by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Detailed demographic and clinical characteristics of all subjects were also analyzed. RESULTS: The clinical presentation of IR was identified in the NAFLD group but not in the healthy control group. Significant differences were found in the levels of several short-, medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines. A high degree of correlation (r> 0.7) was found between even-numbered-carbon long-chain acylcarnitines in NAFLD patients. The area under the receiver operator characteristic of long-chain acylcarnitines, especially C20 (AUC= 0.952), C16:1 (AUC= 0.949) and C14:1OH (AUC=0.944) acylcarnitines, was greater in NAFLD patients than in healthy control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The accumulation and disorders of acylcarnitines are associated with NAFLD. A positive correlation between even-numbered-carbon long-chain acylcarnitines was found, and these even-numbered-carbon longchain acylcarnitines. could be used as potential novel screening markers for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

Different software for peak recognition and matching use different algorithms, leading to different extract results. Therefore, integration of results from different software can obtain richer metabolome information, but the redundant features should be removed. In this study, an integrated strategy of fusing features and removing redundancy based on graph density (FRRGD) was proposed. A graph is used to cover the ion features generated by two open access software (XCMS, MZmine 2) and a software (SIEVE) from an instrument vendor, and redundant features were removed by searching the maximal complete sub-graphs. A standard mixture containing 41 metabolites and a spontaneous urine were utilized to develop the method and demonstrate its usefulness. For the standard mixture, 19, 19 and 27 metabolites were extracted by XCMS, MZmine 2 and SIEVE, respectively. After fusion by FRRGD, 37 metabolites were obtained. For the diluted spontaneous urine sample, 1103, 1500 and 387 metabolites were extracted by XCMS, MZmine 2 and SIEVE, respectively, FRRGD produced 1619 metabolites which were much more than individual software, significantly increasing metabolome coverage. The proposed FRRGD shows a great prospect as a new data processing strategy for metabolomics study. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effects of Genetic Variation on Urinary Small Molecule Signatures of Mice after Exposure to Ionizing Radiation: A Study of p53 Deficiency	METABOLITES			English	Article						biodosimetry; p53; ionizing radiation; urine; metabolomics; acute radiation syndrome; mass spectrometry	METABOLOMICS; METABOLISM; ACTIVATION; BIODOSIMETRY; SENSITIVITY; BIOMARKERS; HISTAMINE; PROTECTS; PLASMA; SERUM	Due to risks from potential exposures to ionizing radiation (IR), improved radiological countermeasures are required, as well as rapid high-throughput biodosimetry. Genotypic variation in the general population contributes to differences in radiosensitivity that may affect biodosimetry accuracy. Previous studies utilized radiosensitive mutant mouse models (Parp1(-/-) and Atm(-/-)) to determine the effects of genotypic deficiency on radiation signatures. Here, we extend this approach by examining changes in the urinary metabolome in a hematopoietic (HP) resistant mouse model (p53(-/-)) after IR exposure. As p53 is a primary regulator in radiation response and apoptosis, limited hematopoietic stem cell apoptosis leads to reduced mortality at doses of similar to 8-10 Gy but increased mortality at higher doses (>15 Gy) due to mitotic catastrophe in gastrointestinal (GI) crypt cells. Urine was collected from mice (wild-type (WT), p53(+/-), and p53(-/-)) pre-irradiation and at 4 and 24 h after total body irradiation (TBI) (WT: 8 and 10 Gy; p53(-/-): 10 Gy) for metabolic phenotyping using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) platform. Minimal differences were detected between unirradiated WT, p53(+/-), and p53(-/-)mice. While similar perturbations were observed for metabolites involved in tryptophan, vitamin B6, and histamine pathways, glycine conjugation, and redox metabolism for WT and p53(-/-) mice after TBI, an overall dampened response was observed in p53-deficient mice. Despite comparable metabolite patterns between genotypes, differentiation was achieved through receiver operating characteristic curve analysis with high specificity and sensitivity for carnitine, N1-acetylspermidine, and creatine. These studies highlight that both attenuated and dampened metabolic responses due to genetic variability in the general population need to be addressed in biodosimetry frameworks.

In the present study, ten Verbascum species including V. cheirantifolium, V. erianthum, V. macrocarpum, V. punalense, V. sinuatum, V. songaricum, V. speciosum, V. stachidiforme, V. thapsus, and V. densiflorum were collected from Iran and their phytochemical characteristics and biological activities were studied. The powdered air-dried aerial flowering parts of the plants were extracted with methanol by maceration. The crude methanolic extracts were further fractionated by solvent-solvent partitioning to obtain various fractions using n-hexane and ethyl acetate. The total phenol and flavonoid, phenolics and iridoids contents and metabolic profiling of the obtained extracts and enriched-fractions were assessed using UV, HPLC-PDA, LC-MS and in silico methods, respectively. Antioxidant activity using DPPH and FRAP methods, and antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were also studied. The highest contents of total phenol (51.94 +/- 2.30 mg GAE/g DW) and total flavonoid (22.57 +/- 1.73 mg QE/g DW) were found in V. sinuatum. The range of the highest content (mg/g DW) among the other compounds were found to be rutin (0.11-21.0), rosmarinic acid (0.33-12.16), p-coumaric acid (0.10-10.22), ferulic acid (0.11-7.82), gentisic acid (0.09-5.73), protocatechuic acid (0.09-4.74), salicylic acid (2.45-4.36), quercetin (0.13-3.21), and harpagoside (0.001-0.320) in the studied species. In addition, twenty-eight compounds were qualitatively identified in the plant extracts. The highest content of metabolites supported the observed highest antioxidant activity in V. speciosum and V. songaricum. Phenolic-enriched fraction of V. songaricum showed the highest antibacterial activity (MIC 0.12 mg/mL) against Staphylococcus aureus. Association analysis showed a significant positive correlation between biological properties and phenolic compounds. In conclusion, V. songaricum and V. sinuatum could be selected as adequate species for further exploitation in agricultural systems and pharmaceutical industry.

Samples were analyzed in both positive and negative electron ionization modes. Data were analyzed by multivariate statistical methods for biomarker metabolites that were differentially abundant in brown milk and fermented brown milk. We identified 43 differentially abundant metabolites based on mass spectrophotometry fragmentation patterns. These metabolites included peptides, AA, fatty acids and related metabolites, carbohydrate metabolites, vitamins, and nucleosides. Some of these metabolites are known to alter the sensorial quality of fermented dairy products. Thus, it is likely that some of the currently identified differentially abundant metabolites also contribute to the unique flavor, taste, and aroma of fermented brown milk. The bitterness and astringency of fermented brown milk are likely to be due to some of these peptides, whereas the sweetness and sourness could be a result of changes in carbohydrate levels. No previous study has analyzed metabolomics changes during fermentation of brown milk. Thus, our data are a valuable reference for future development and improvement of fermented brown milk products.

Here, we used a combined LC-MS and NMR approach to reveal the metabolomics changes in the hemolymph of honeybees infected by this obligate intracellular parasite. For metabolic profiling, hemolymph samples were collected from both uninfected and N. ceranae-infected bees at two time points, 2 days and 10 days after the experimental infection of emergent bees. Hemolymph samples were individually analyzed by LC-MS, whereas each NMR spectrum was obtained from a pool of three hemolymphs. Multivariate statistical PLS-DA models clearly showed that the age of bees was the parameter with the strongest effect on the metabolite profiles. Interestingly, a total of 15 biomarkers were accurately identified and were assigned as candidate biomarkers representative of infection alone or combined effect of age and infection. These biomarkers included carbohydrates (alpha/beta glucose, alpha/beta fructose and hexosamine), amino acids (histidine and proline), dipeptides (Glu-Thr, Cys-Cys and gamma-Glu-Leu/Ile), metabolites involved in lipid metabolism (choline, glycerophosphocholine and O-phosphorylethanolamine) and a polyamine compound (spermidine). Our study demonstrated that this untargeted metabolomics-based approach may be useful for a better understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms of the honeybee infection by N. ceranae.

Methods: Sixteen lactating dairy cows with similar parity and days in milk were divided into high-yield (HY) and low-yield (LY) groups based on milk yield. On day 21, rumen fluid metabolites were quantified applying LC/MS. Results: The principal component analysis and orthogonal correction partial least squares discriminant analysis showed significantly separated clusters of the ruminal metabolite profiles of HY and LY groups. Compared with HY group, a total of 24 ruminal metabolites were significantly greater in LY group, such as 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, carboxylic acids, carboxylic acid derivatives (L-isoleucine, L-valine, L-tyrosine, etc.), diazines (uracil, thymine, cytosine), and palmitic acid, while the concentrations of 30 metabolites were dramatically decreased in LY group compared to HY group, included gentisic acid, caprylic acid, and myristic acid. The metabolite enrichment analysis indicated that protein digestion and absorption, ABC transporters and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis were significantly different between the two groups. Correlation analysis between the ruminal microbiome and metabolites revealed that certain typical metabolites were exceedingly associated with definite ruminal bacteria; Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Synergistetes phyla were highly correlated with most metabolites. Conclusion: These findings revealed that the ruminal metabolite profiles were significantly different between HY and LY groups, and these results may provide novel insights to evaluate biomarkers for a better feed digestion and may reveal the potential mechanism underlying the difference in milk yield in dairy cows.

Even less is known about the effects of chemical pollution exposure on the metabolome of aquatic invertebrates. We conducted an in situ translocation experiment with passive filter-feeding caddisfly larvae (Hydropsyche sp.) in an effluent-influenced river in order to i) unravel the bioaccumulation (and recovery) dynamics of ECs in aquatic invertebrates, and ii) test whether exposure to environmentally realistic concentrations of ECs will translate into metabolic profile changes in the insects. The experiment was carried out at two sites, upstream and downstream of the discharge of an urban wastewater treatment plant effluent. The translocated animals were collected at 2-week intervals for 46 days. Both pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) were detected in water (62 and 7 compounds, respectively), whereas in Hydropsyche tissues 5 EDCs accumulated. Overall, specimens from the upstream site translocated to the impacted site reached higher ECs concentrations in their tissues, as a reflection of the contaminants' water concentrations. However, bioaccumulation was a temporary process susceptible to change under lower contaminant concentrations. Non-targeted metabolite profiling detected fine metabolic changes in translocated Hydropsyche larvae. Both translocations equally induced stress, but it was higher in animals translocated to the impacted site. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that tumor proliferation and metastasis are closely related to complex metabolic reprogramming. However, there are limited data to provide a comprehensive metabolic picture of osteosarcoma. Objectives Our study aims to identify aberrant metabolic pathways and seek potential adjuvant biomarkers for osteosarcoma. Methods Serum samples were collected from 65 osteosarcoma patients and 30 healthy controls. Nontargeted metabolomic profiling was performed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based on univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. Results The OPLS-DA model analysis identified clear separations among groups. We identified a set of differential metabolites such as higher serum levels of adenosine-5-monophosphate, inosine-5-monophosphate and guanosine monophosphate in primary OS patients compared to healthy controls, and higher serum levels of 5-aminopentanamide, 13(S)-HpOTrE (FA 18:3 + 2O) and methionine sulfoxide in lung metastatic OS patients compared to primary OS patients, revealing aberrant metabolic features during the proliferation and metastasis of osteosarcoma. We found a group of metabolites especially lactic acid and glutamic acid, with AUC values of 0.97 and 0.98, which could serve as potential adjuvant diagnostic biomarkers for primary osteosarcoma, and a panel of 2 metabolites, 5-aminopentanamide and 13(S)-HpOTrE (FA 18:3 + 2O), with an AUC value of 0.92, that had good monitoring ability for lung metastases. Conclusions Our study provides new insight into the aberrant metabolic features of osteosarcoma. The potential biomarkers identified here may have translational significance.

J	Yang, KD; Xu, MY; Zhu, JJ				Yang, Kundi; Xu, Mengyang; Zhu, Jiangjiang			Evaluating the Impact of Four Major Nutrients on Gut Microbial Metabolism by a Targeted Metabolomics Approach	JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH			English	Article						gut microbiome; metabolomics; targeted mass spectrometry; medium nutrition	GEN. NOV.	Gut microbiome plays fundamental roles in host physiolo and gut microbial metabolism is important to the host-microbiome homeostasis. As major contributors to gut microbial metabolism, the medium nutritional components are essential to in vitro gut microbiome growths, and four nutrients, namely, inorganic salts, bile salts, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and mucin, have gained particular attention because of their significant variation found in different growth environments and their ability to modulate the gut microbial population and functions. However, a systematic study is lacking to evaluate the effects of these four nutrients on the gut microbiome in terms of their impact on the microbial metabolic profiles. To fill the gap of the knowledge, we applied mass-spectrometrybased targeted metabolomics approach to study the regulation effects of these four medium components on in vitro-cultured gut microbiota. Our results show that inorganic salts and mucin had the greatest impacts on the gut microbiome metabolic profile compared to the other components studied, with gut microbial cultures grown with low-concentration inorganic salts and mucin-supplemented medium demonstrating greater numbers of metabolites detected. We also applied metabolic pathway impact analysis, which revealed several significantly impacted metabolic pathways during the comparison of different medium supplements, which could further assist our understanding of the overall impacts of certain critical nutrients on gut microbial metabolism. In summary, this pilot study can serve as a first attempt to evaluate the individual nutritional component in their contribution to gut microbial metabolic functions.

However, the mechanism of the balanced co-existence between the host immune system andS. japonicumas well as their complex interaction remains unclear. In this study,16SrRNA gene sequencing, combined with metagenomic sequencing approach as well as ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolic profiling, was applied to demonstrate changes in the gut microbiome community structure during schistosomiasis progression, the functional interactions between the gut bacteria andS. japonicuminfection in BALB/c mice, and the dynamic metabolite changes of the host. The results showed that both gut microbiome and the metabolites were significantly altered at different time points after the infection. Decrease in richness and diversity as well as differed composition of the gut microbiota was observed in the infected status when compared with the uninfected status. At the phylum level, the gut microbial communities in all samples were dominated by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Deferribacteres, while at the genus level,Lactobacillus, Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group, Bacteroides, Staphylococcus, andAlloprevotellawere the most abundant. After exposure,Roseburia, andRuminococcaceae UCG-014decreased, whileStaphylococcus, Alistipes, andParabacteroidesincreased, which could raise the risk of infections. Furthermore, LEfSe demonstrated several bacterial taxa that could discriminate between each time point ofS. japonicuminfection. Besides that, metagenomic analysis illuminated that the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway and the chemokine signaling pathway were significantly perturbed after the infection. Phosphatidylcholine and colfosceril palmitate in serum as well as xanthurenic acid, naphthalenesulfonic acid, and pimelylcarnitine in urine might be metabolic biomarkers due to their promising diagnostic potential at the early stage of the infection. Alterations of glycerophospholipid and purine metabolism were also discovered in the infection. The present study might provide further understanding of the mechanisms during schistosome infection in aspects of gut microbiome and metabolites, and facilitate the discovery of new targets for early diagnosis and prognostic purposes. Further validations of potential biomarkers in human populations are necessary, and the exploration of interactions amongS. japonicum, gut microbiome, and metabolites is to be deepened in the future.

The aim of this study was to investigate the metabolic characteristics and related metabolic enzyme changes during the progression from chronic hepatitis B (CHB) to liver cirrhosis (LC) and, ultimately, to HCC. An untargeted metabolomics assay was performed in plasma from 50 healthy volunteers, 43 CHB patients, 67 LC patients, and 39 HCC patients. A total of 24 differential metabolites (DMs) were identified. Joint pathway analysis suggested striking changes in amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism from CHB to HCC. The panel of L-serine, creatine and glycine distinguished LC from CHB, and L-serine, cystathionine, creatine and linoleic acid distinguished HCC from LC. Bioinformatic analysis of publicly available data showed that differential metabolite profile-associated enzyme genes, including alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase-2 (AGXT2), D-amino-acid oxidase (DAO), and cystathionine gamma-lyase (CTH), were downregulated, while bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM), cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS), phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH) and acyl-CoA thioesterase 7 (ACOT7) were upregulated, in HCC, all of which correlated with a poor prognosis for HCC patients. Our results indicated that serum metabolites and related enzymes are of considerable significance for the diagnosis and prognosis of HCC and can provide a theoretical basis and therapeutic index for future diagnosis and treatment.

In this study, we investigated the alterations in metabolite profiles of the hippocampal tissues from 6, 8, and 12 month-old wild-type (WT) and 5xfamiliar AD (5xFAD) mice, an AD mouse model harboring 5 early-onset familiar AD mutations, which shows memory loss from approximately 5 months of age, by exploiting the untargeted metabolomics profiling. We found that nicotinamide and adenosine monophosphate levels have been significantly decreased while lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) (16:0), LysoPC (18:0), and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LysoPE) (16:0) levels have been significantly increased in the hippocampi from 5xFAD mice at 8 months or 12 months of age, compared to those from age-matched wild-type mice. In the present study, we focused on the role of nicotinamide and examined if replenishment of nicotinamide exerts attenuating effects on the reduction in dendritic spine density in hippocampal primary neurons from 5xFAD mice. Treatment with nicotinamide attenuated the deficits in spine density in the hippocampal primary neurons derived from 5xFAD mice, indicating a potential role of nicotinamide in the pathogenesis of AD. Taken together, these findings suggest that the decreased hippocampal nicotinamide level could be linked with AD pathogenesis and be a useful therapeutic target for AD.

Understanding of its metabolism contributes to determine the druggability of coumarin in vivo. A sensitive and efficient strategy based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS) analysis combined with various data-processing techniques including metabolomics and multiple mass defect filter (MMDF) was established for the comprehensive screening and elucidation of potential coumarin metabolites. Total 20 metabolites of scoparone were identified in this study, including 14 undescribed metabolites. The metabolism of two other similar coumarins scopoletin and esculetin also could be determined using this strategy. By the established strategy, this study gives the insights about the major metabolic pathways of scoparone in vivo and in vitro metabolism, including demethylation, hydroxylation, hydration, cysteine conjugation, glucuronide conjugation and sulfate conjugation. Additionally, the metabolic pathways of scopoletin and esculetin were determined as hydroxylation, glucuronidation and sulfation. These results contribute to the understanding of metabolic characterization of coumarins, and demonstrate that the combination of UPLC-MS-based metabolomics and MMDF is a powerful approach to determine the metabolic pathways of coumarin compounds.

Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can disrupt fetal neuronal development and cause an ADHD-like hyperactive behavior in the offspring. In this study, we hypothesized that metabolic disturbance would involve in ADHD neuropathology and aimed to investigate the changes in metabolite profile in PAE-induced ADHD-like model and the effects of HX106, a nutraceutical, on ADHD-like pathophysiology and metabolite changes. To this end, we administered HX106 to the mouse offspring affected by PAE (OPAE) and assessed the hyperactivity using the open field test. We observed that HX106-treated OPAE showed less hyperactive behavior than vehicle-treated OPAE. The effects of HX106 were found to be related to the regulation of dopamine transporter and D2 dopamine receptor expression. Furthermore, using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, we explored the metabolite changes among the experimental groups. The metabolite profile, particularly related with the amino acids, linoleic acid and amino sugar pathways, was altered by PAE and reversed by HX106 treatment partially similar to that observed in the control group.

To investigate the effect of mitochondrial dysfunction on the stress response and the impact on various biological domains linked to the pathobiology of depression, a novel mouse model was created. These mice harbor a gene trap in the first intron of the Ndufs4 gene (Ndufs4(GT/GT) mice), encoding the NDUFS4 protein, a structural component of complex I (CI), the first enzyme of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. We performed a comprehensive behavioral screening with a broad range of behavioral, physiological, and endocrine markers, high-resolution ex vivo brain imaging, brain immunohistochemistry, and multi-platform targeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Ndufs4(GT/GT) mice presented with a 25% reduction of CI activity in the hippocampus, resulting in a relatively mild phenotype of reduced body weight, increased physical activity, decreased neurogenesis and neuroinflammation compared to WT littermates. Brain metabolite profiling revealed characteristic biosignatures discriminating Ndufs4(GT/GT) from WT mice. Specifically, we observed a reversed TCA cycle flux and rewiring of amino acid metabolism in the prefrontal cortex. Next, exposing mice to chronic variable stress (a model for depression-like behavior), we found that Ndufs4(GT/GT) mice showed altered stress response and coping strategies with a robust stress-associated reprogramming of amino acid metabolism. Our data suggest that impaired mitochondrial CI function is a candidate driver for altered stress reactivity and stress-induced brain metabolic reprogramming. These changes result in unique phenomic and metabolomic signatures distinguishing groups based on their mitochondrial genotype.

According to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theories on the "lung-spleen-intestine axis" and its correlation with ALI, a high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-QTOF-MS) metabolomic platform was applied to identify biomarkers from five bio-samples of control and model rats challenged with intratracheally administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS) based on multivariate mathematical statistical analysis. As a result, 19, 24, 24, 15 and 29 altered metabolites were identified in serum, lung, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), spleen and feces samples, respectively. Metabolic pathway analysis showed that linoleic acid, sphingolipid, glycerophospholipid and bile acid metabolism pathways were mainly altered by ALI. Additionally, ROC curves were applied to assess the specificity and sensitivity of the biomarkers. ALI characteristic metabolomic spectra were then established to differentiate the control from the model group with a similarity discriminative threshold of 0.7. Additionally, to compare the metabolomic profiles of the five bio-samples and establish metabolic similarities and differences among them, correlation analysis was conducted in order to delineate an objective law of endogenous linkage along the lung-spleen-intestine axis. Therefore, this study provides insights into the mechanisms involved in ALI from a metabolomics perspective, which can be applied in characterization of the mechanism and early disease detection.

Interestingly, goose fatty liver can reach 8-10 times the weight of normal liver with no overt pathological symptoms, suggesting that there are some protective mechanisms. Scientists have indicated that gut microbiota participate in the formation of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in human and mammalian animals. However, it is unclear whether gut microbiota and their metabolites contribute to goose fatty liver. The aim of the present study was to investigate the metabolomic analyses of liver and intestinal contents in overfed vs. normally fed geese. The results showed that the formation of goose fatty liver is accompanied by obvious changes in the metabolic profiles of liver and intestinal contents. The intestinal metabolites can affect the formation of goose fatty liver by affecting the metabolisms of glucose and fatty acid, oxidative stress, and inflammatory reactions. These findings provide a basis for future work addressing the relationship between intestinal metabolites and the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. No overt pathological symptoms are observed in the goose liver with severe steatosis, suggesting that geese may host unique protective mechanisms. Gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry-based metabolomics analyses of liver and intestinal contents in overfed vs. normally fed geese (26 geese in each treatment) were investigated. We found that overfeeding significantly changed the metabolic profiles of liver and intestinal contents. The differential metabolites mainly belong to fatty acids, amino acids, organic acids, and amines. The differential metabolites were involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, glycerolipid metabolism, the pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid degradation, the sphingolipid signaling pathway, and the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. Moreover, we determined the biological effects of arachidonic acid (ARA) and tetrahydrocorticosterone (TD) in goose primary hepatocytes and intestinal cells. Data showed that the mRNA expression of arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5) in goose primary intestinal cells was significantly induced by 0.50 mM ARA treatment. Cytochrome P-450 27A1 (CYP27A1) mRNA expression was significantly inhibited in goose primary hepatocytes by 1 mu M TD treatment. In conclusion, the formation of goose fatty liver is accompanied by significant changes in the metabolic profiles of liver and intestinal contents, and the changes are closely related to the metabolisms of glucose and fatty acids, oxidative stress, and inflammatory reactions.

The UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS method was used to characterize phytochemicals in most potent extract. Thirteen bioactive compounds/metabolites including (2S)-3-(beta-D-galactopyranosyloxy)-2-(hexanoyloxy)propyl nonanoate, 4-O-beta-D-glucosyl-4-coumaric acid, isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside, 7-(alpha-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyheptanoic acid, 13S-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, astragaloside derivative, salicylic acid, oleanolic acid, citric acid, pinellic acid, quinic acid, caffeic acid derivative and caffeic acid-3-glucoside were detected in 80% hydroethanolic (HE) extract. Among different extracts (aqueous, 20-80% HE and pure ethanolic), 80% HE extract showed maximum TPC (186.19 +/- 2.15 mg GAE/g DE) and TFC (106.50 +/- 1.68 mg RE/g DE). A strong correlation was observed between TPC, TFC, DPPH radical scavenging (IC50 = 60.64 +/- 1.74 mu g/mL) and TAP activity (235.96 +/- 1.33 mg AAE/g DE) of 80% HE extract among others. The same extract also depicted highest alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase enzyme inhibition with IC(50)of 71.84 +/- 1.06 and 57.25 +/- 1.40 mu g/mL, respectively. Molecular docking was performed to explore possible role of identified phytochemicals. Binding affinity data as well as interaction patterns have revealed possible interaction of the identified bioactives against alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase. Moreover, intra-molecular charge transfer, energies of the FMOs, HOMO-LUMO-E-gaps, MEP and IP were also explained.

Biochemical compounds synthesised by plants ameliorate the effects of such stressors in characteristic ways. It is crucial to unravel the key components of the salt tolerance network to engineer salt-tolerant genotypes of crops. For the elucidation of the metabolic contribution to salinity response (long-term stress under 100 mM NaCl) in selected cultivars, we used a gas chromatography mass spectrometry approach. The metabolic profiling of grains yielded sixty-five metabolites. By comparing a salt-sensitive cultivar of barley (Scope) to a salt-tolerant one (GrangeR), we identified six and twenty significant metabolites in salt-stressed seeds of Scope and GrangeR, respectively. These included amino acids, sugars, sugar derivatives and organic acids. Whilst the concentrations of fructose reduced, glycine, glucitol and urea accumulated under salt stress in both varieties. Amino acids such as phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine, sugar acids such as galactaric acid and glucuronic acid, and several other key meta-bolites accumulated in GrangeR only. These metabolites are relevant to metabolic pathways of amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, pyruvate metabolism, shikimate pathway, TCA cycle, inositol phosphate metabolism and galactose metabolism. Hence these com-pounds could be potentially used as biomarkers of abiotic stress responses and effects on grain quality and yield parameters. This work provides greater insights into functional metabolism in response to salinity stress and may help to dissect patterns associated with salt responses. Metabolites identified in this work could serve as accurate markers for salt-tolerant crop selection in breeding programs.

SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CHLOROPHYLL DEGRADATION; SEAWEED EXTRACTS; BIOSTIMULANTS; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; TOCOPHEROL; PHYTOL; TOLERANCE; RUBISCO; LIGHT; WATER	The present study investigates the biostimulant effects of 18 Crude Bio-Extracts (CBEs) obtained from Microalgae and Cyanobacteria on tomato plant growth, chlorophyll content, nutrient uptake and metabolite profile. Significant root and shoot length improvement (112.65%, 53.70%); was recorded at treatment with Aphanothece sp and C. ellipsoidea CBEs respectively. Meanwhile, the highest root and shoot dry weight (DW) (34.81%, 58.69%) were obtained at treatment with Aphanothece sp. The latter also displayed the maximum uptake of Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, which increased by 185.17%, 119.36% and 78.04% respectively compared with non-treated plants. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) confirmed that Phosphorus and Potassium levels in roots were closely related to enhanced Root length, whereas Nitrogen and chlorophyll b were closely related to Shoot and root DW. Additionally, Gas Chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) indicated that treatment with CBEs, induced the production of a vast array of metabolites. Treated plants recorded higher accumulation of palmitic and stearic acids, which could indicate a stimulation in de novo Lipid synthesis. CBEs also triggered the accumulation of pyridine-3-carboxamide (an amide active form of vitamin B3) and Linolenic acid; one of the key precursors in the biosynthetic pathway leading to plant jasmonates. Our results are a first step towards understanding the effects of microalgal extracts on plant physiology and biochemical pathways. Further investigations on biochemical fractionation of microalgal extracts and agronomic tests of their purified bioactive compounds could be a useful principal novelty for in-depth study of CBE action mechanisms. Other useful tools include; Comparative hormone profiling of treated and non-treated plants accompanied with combined High-Throughput Plant Phenotyping, transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis.

Chronic coronary ischemia leads to ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM). Despite their rising prevalence and morbidity, few studies have discussed the lipids alterations in these patients. Methods In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed serum lipids profile in IHD and ICM patients using a lipidomics approach. Consecutive consenting patients admitted to the hospital for IHD and ICM were enrolled. Serum samples were obtained after overnight fasting. Non-targeted metabolomics was applied to demonstrate lipids metabolic profile in control, IHD and ICM patients. Results A total of 63 and 62 lipids were detected in negative and positive ion mode respectively. Among them, 16:0 Lyso PI, 18:1 Lyso PI in negative ion mode, and 19:0 Lyso PC, 12:0 SM d18:1/12:0, 15:0 Lyso PC, 17:0 PC, 18:1-18:0 PC in positive ion mode were significantly altered both in IHD and ICM as compared to control. 13:0 Lyso PI, 18:0 Lyso PI, 16:0 PE, 14:0 PC DMPC, 16:0 ceramide, 18:0 ceramide in negative ion mode, and 17:0 PE, 19:0 PC, 14:0 Lyso PC, 20:0 Lyso PC, 18:0 PC DSPC, 18:0-22:6 PC in positive ion mode were significantly altered only in ICM as compared to IHD and control. Conclusion Using non-targeted lipidomics profiling, we have successfully identified a group of circulating lipids that were significantly altered in IHD and ICM. The lipids metabolic signatures shed light on potential new biomarkers and therapeutics for preventing and treating ICM.

Daniel; Frank, Matthias			Metabolic Profiling of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) Emitted by the Pathogens Francisella tularensis and Bacillus anthracis in Liquid Culture	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							BACTERIA; DIFFERENTIATION; ALCOHOLS; DISEASE	We conducted comprehensive (untargeted) metabolic profiling of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted in culture by bacterial taxa Francisella tularensis (F. tularensis) subspecies novicida and Bacillus anthracis (B. anthracis) Sterne, surrogates for potential bacterial bioterrorism agents, as well as selective measurements of VOCs from their fully virulent counterparts, F. tularensis subspecies tularensis strain SCHU S4 and B. anthracis Ames. F. tularensis and B. anthracis were grown in liquid broth for time periods that covered logarithmic growth, stationary, and decline phases. VOCs emitted over the course of the growth phases were collected from the headspace above the cultures using solid phase microextraction (SPME) and were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). We developed criteria for distinguishing VOCs originating from bacteria versus background VOCs (originating from growth media only controls or sampling devices). Analyses of collected VOCs revealed methyl ketones, alcohols, esters, carboxylic acids, and nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compounds that were present in the bacterial cultures and absent (or present at only low abundance) in control samples indicating that these compounds originated from the bacteria. Distinct VOC profiles where observed for F. tularensis when compared with B. anthracis while the observed profiles of each of the two F. tularensis and B. anthracis strains exhibited some similarities. Furthermore, the relative abundance of VOCs was influenced by bacterial growth phase. These data illustrate the potential for VOC profiles to distinguish pathogens at the genus and species-level and to discriminate bacterial growth phases. The determination of VOC profiles lays the groundwork for non-invasive probes of bacterial metabolism and offers prospects for detection of microbe-specific VOC biomarkers from two potential biowarfare agents.

However, the absence of an integrated analytical platform, focusing on customized, validated extraction steps, generates tendentious and non-reproducible data regarding the phytochemical profile. Such a platform would also support the exploration and exploitation of plant byproducts, which are a valuable source of bioactive metabolites. This study deals with the incorporation of (a) the currently sub-exploited high energy extraction methods (ultrasound (UAE)- and microwave-assisted extraction (MAE)), (b) experimental design (DOE), and (c) metabolomics, in an integrated analytical platform for the extensive study of plant metabolomics and phytochemical profiling. The recovery of carotenoids from apricot by-products (pulp) is examined as a case study. MAE, using ethanol as solvent, achieved higher carotenoid yields compared to UAE, where 1:1 chloroform-methanol was employed, and classic extraction. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomic profiling classified extracts according to the variations in co-extractives in relation to the extraction conditions. Extracts with a lower carotenoid content contained branched-chain amino acids as co-extractives. Medium carotenoid content extracts contained choline, unsaturated fatty acids, and sugar alcohols, while the highest carotenoid extracts were also rich in sugars. Overall, the proposed pipeline can provide different the phytochemical fractions of bioactive compounds according to the needs of different industrial sectors (cosmetics, nutraceuticals, etc.).

In silicoandin vitrometabolism of ribociclib: a mass spectrometric approach to bioactivation pathway elucidation and metabolite profiling	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							REACTIVE METABOLITES; TYROSINE KINASES; MS/MS REVEALS; PHASE-I; VITRO; PALBOCICLIB; INHIBITORS	Ribociclib (RBC, Kisqali (R)) is a highly selective CDK4/6 inhibitor that has been approved for breast cancer therapy. Initially, prediction of susceptible sites of metabolism and reactivity pathways were performed by the StarDrop WhichP450 (TM) module and the Xenosite web predictor tool, respectively. Later,in vitrometabolites and adducts ofRBCwere characterized from rat liver microsomes using LC-MS/MS. Subsequently,in silicodata was used as a guide for thein vitrowork. Finally,in silicotoxicity assessment ofRBCmetabolites was carried out using DEREK software and structural modification was proposed to reduce their side effects and to validate the bioactivation pathway theory using the StarDrop DEREK module.In vitrophase I metabolic profiling ofRBCwas performed utilizing rat liver microsomes (RLMs). Generation of reactive metabolites was investigated using potassium cyanide (KCN) as a trapping nucleophile for the transient and reactive iminium intermediates to form a stable cyano adduct that can be identified and characterized using mass spectrometry. Nine phase I metabolites and one cyano adduct ofRBCwere characterized. The proposed metabolic pathways involved in generation of these metabolites are hydroxylation, oxidation and reduction. The reactive intermediate generation mechanism ofRBCmay provide an explanation of its adverse reactions. Aryl piperazine is considered a structural alert for toxicity as proposed by the DEREK report. We propose that the generation of only one reactive metabolite ofRBCin a very small concentration is due to the decreased reactivity of the piperazine ring compared to previous reports of similar drugs. Docking analysis was performed forRBCand its proposed derivatives at the active site of the human CDK6 enzyme.Methyl-RBCexhibited the best ADMET and docking analysis and fewer side effects compared toRBCandfluoro-RBC. Further drug discovery studies can be conducted taking into account this concept allowing the development of new drugs with enhanced safety profiles that were confirmed by using StarDrop software. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first literature report ofRBCin vitrometabolic profiling and structural characterization and toxicological properties of the generated metabolites.

Using a non-targeted approach, plant metabolites and xenobiotics of interest are identified and localized in plant tissues to uncover specific distribution patterns. Then, in silico prediction of potential metabolites (i.e., catabolites and conjugates) from the identified xenobiotics is performed. When a xenobiotic metabolite is located in the tissue, the type of enzyme involved in its alteration by the plant is recorded. These results were used to describe different types of biological reactions occurring in S. alba leaves in response to xenobiotic accumulation in the leaves. The metabolites were predicted in two generations, allowing the documentation of successive biological reactions to transform xenobiotics in the leaf tissues.

Despite extensive research on the plant's active constituents, little attention has yet been paid to characterizing the relationship between its intra-specific genetic diversity and metabolite profile. The study aimed to determine metabolic profile of H. italicum ssp. italicum (HII) and ssp. tyrrhenicum (HIT) cultivated on the experimental plantation in Slovenia and to compare the chemical composition of extracts regarding the solvent extraction process. Extracts were prepared upon conventional extract preparation procedures: maceration with 50% methanol or ethanol and cold or hot water infusion and analyzed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Diode Array Detection-Electrospray Ionization-Quadrupole Time-of-Flight-Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-ESI-QTOF-MS). One hundred compounds were identified in the samples, among them several isomers and derivatives were reported for the first time, while caffeoylquinic acids and pyrones were the most abundant. Semi-quantitative comparison revealed that the extraction procedure had a greater impact on the chemical profile than genetic variability. All HIT extracts showed a higher total phenolic content compared to HII, while the antioxidant potential evaluated by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazil test was not proportionally higher. In addition, hot water extracts proved to be comparably active as alcoholic ones, confirming high commercial potential of Helichrysum italicum as herbal functional beverages.

Among the six organisms, a sample of Aspergillus fumigatus culture showed an extra peak at 3.5 min in the high performance liquid chromatography chromatogram when compared with its controls, indicating the formation of metabolite. The metabolite thus formed was confirmed by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy as 4-hydroxy norclobazam. Enzyme induction and inhibition studies were conducted on the involvement of a CYP3A4-like enzyme in fungal biotransformation. Enzyme kinetic studies were conducted to determine the affinity of the enzyme to the substrate. The study revealed that A. fumigatus can be used as a microbial resource to analyse the complete metabolic profile of clobazam with a maximum concentration 30 mu g/ml.

D. officinale protocorms (DOPs) are the conical embryonic tissues formed after seed germination. Previous studies suggest that these different plant parts possess similar pharmacological activities. However, the metabolic profiles and gene expression across different growth stages of D. officinale remain unknown. In this study, metabolome analysis based on GC and LC/MS/MS was carried out to assess the metabolic profile of both DOPs and Mat. Transcriptome analysis was used to reveal internal relationships between metabolites and the differing gene regulation. The results indicated that although DOPs and Mat had a similar chemical composition, they exhibited different patterns of content. GO classification and KEGG clustering of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between DOPs and Mat demonstrated that gene enrichment was mainly related to flavonoid biosynthetic and metabolic processes, carbohydrate metabolic processes, and polysaccharide catabolic processes. An alteration in gene expression related to specific metabolic pathways offered a probable explanation for the observed differences in metabolites between DOPs and Mat. This work provides a foundation for subsequent studies regarding the biosynthetic pathways of related metabolites from D. officinalis.

Taohong Siwu Decoction (THSWD), a classical traditional Chinese medication that promotes blood circulation, is clinically beneficial in CHD. However, the underlying mechanism of THSWD is still unclear. To comprehensively understand the material foundation of the "blood", it is significantly important to study the differential metabolites involved in the treatment of CHD with Chinese medicinal herb promoting blood circulation in TCM theory. Hence, this study investigated the metabolic profiles of the serum in CHD patients to determine the differential metabolites between the THSWD group and the placebo group. Eleven CHD patients were recruited and divided into two groups randomly and double-blindly. Serum samples were determined by performing non-targeted ultra-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to assess the association between identified metabolites and clinical serum indexes of CHD. Based on the result, a total of 513 metabolites were found in the serum of CHD patients, of which 27, involved in 29 metabolic pathways, were significantly different between the two groups. Among the differential metabolites, THSWD upregulated succinylcarnitine in fatty acid metabolism and 5 '-methylthioadenosine in cysteine and methionine metabolism compared with the placebo group. However, THSWD downregulated pelargonic acid, involved in FA metabolism; succinate, involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle; gluconic acid, gluconolactone, and d-glucose, involved in pentose phosphate pathway; glycerophosphocholine, involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism; 8,9-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (8,9-DiHETrE), l-lysine, N-acetyl-l-aspartic acid, N-alpha-acetyl-l-asparagine, hippurate, indoxyl sulfate, and 3-ureidopropionate involved in amino acid metabolism compared with the placebo group. Moreover, succinylcarnitine, pelargonic acid, succinate, d-glucose, gluconic acid, l-lysine, N-alpha-acetyl-l-asparagine, 5 '-methylthioadenosine, indoxyl sulfate, 8,9-DiHETrE, and 3-ureidopropionate were associated with total cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein. Succinylcarnitine, pelargonic acid, gluconolactone, N-acetyl-l-aspartic acid, N-alpha-acetyl-l-asparagine, hippurate, and 5 '-methylthioadenosine were associated with activated partial thromboplastin time. Our findings indicated that glycerophosphocholine, 8,9-DiHETrE, 5 '-methylthioadenosine, hippurate, indoxyl sulfate, and 3-ureidopropionate might constitute the partial material foundation of the "blood" in CHD patients treated with THSWD.

On the other hand, it is known that obesity is associated with increased serum levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs: valine; leucine and isoleucine) and aromatic amino acids. The aim of the study is to compare the metabolic fingerprint of girls with TS to the metabolic fingerprint of girls with obesity. Metabolic fingerprinting using an untargeted metabolomic approach was examined in plasma from 46 girls with TS (study group) and 22 age-matched girls with obesity (control group). The mean values of BCAAs, methionine, phenylalanine, lysine, tryptophan, histidine, tyrosine, alanine and ornithine were significantly lower in the study group than in the control (p from 0.0025 to <0.000001). Strong significant correlation between BCAAs, phenylalanine, arginine, tyrosine, glutamic acid, citrulline and alanine, and body mass index expressed as standard deviation score BMI-SDS in the patients with obesity (p from 0.049 to 0.0005) was found. In contrast; there was no correlation between these amino acids and BMI-SDS in the girls with TS. It is suggested that obesity in patients with TS is not associated with altered amino acids metabolism.

Comparative proteomic analysis of serum from nonhuman primates administered BIO 300: a promising radiation countermeasure	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							MEDICAL COUNTERMEASURES; ESTROGEN-RECEPTORS; IONIZING-RADIATION; APPROVAL STATUS; GENISTEIN; AMIFOSTINE; EXPOSURE; CANCER; UPDATE; MICE	Hematopoietic acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) and delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE) are detrimental health effects that occur after exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation. BIO 300, a synthetic genistein nanosuspension, was previously proven safe and effective against H-ARS when administered (via the oral (po) or intramuscular (im) route) prior to exposure to lethal doses of total-body radiation. In this study, we evaluated the proteomic changes in serum of nonhuman primates (NHP) after administering BIO 300 by different routes (po and im). We utilized nanoflow-ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (NanoUPLC-MS/MS) methods for comprehensive global profiling and quantification of serum proteins. The results corroborate previous findings that suggest a very similar metabolic profile following both routes of drug administration. Furthermore, we observed minor alterations in protein levels, 2 hours after drug administration, which relates to the C-max of BIO 300 for both routes of administration. Taken together, this assessment may provide an insight into the mechanism of radioprotection of BIO 300 and a reasonable illustration of the pharmacodynamics of this radiation countermeasure.

UPLC-Orbitrap HRMS metabolic profiling of Cymbopogon citratus cultivated in Egypt; neuroprotective effect against AlCl3-induced neurotoxicity in rats	JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Cymbopogon citratus; UPLC-Orbitrap HRMS; Alzheimer's disease; Oxidative stress; Neuroprotective; Inflammatory markers	FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS; C-GLYCOSYL FLAVONES; NF-KAPPA-B; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; AMYLOID-BETA; ELECTROSPRAY-IONIZATION; LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; MEDICINAL-PLANTS; LEMON GRASS	Ethnopharmacological relevance: Cymbopogon citratus (lemongrass) is commonly used in teas, soups and treat inflammatory-based ailments, vascular and nervous disorders. Aim of the study: The study aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of Cymbopogon citratus leaves through scientific protocol. The effect of aqueous (AE) and ethanolic (EE) extracts was evaluated against AlCl3-induced Alzheimer's disease (AD) in rats. Metabolic profiling of the plant, isolation of bioactive compounds and standardization of the active fraction were investigated. Materials and methods: AE of Cymbopogon citratus leaves was prepared as per traditional method (infusion), EE was prepared by repeated maceration in 90% ethanol, bioactive fraction (BAEE) was obtained from EE and the active compounds thereof were obtained by column chromatography. Metabolic profiling of Cymbopogon citratus was performed by UPLC-Orbitrap HRMS and HPLC was used for standardization. AlCl3-induced Alzheimer's rats were used to assess neuroprotective effect of the extracts. Neuroprotective mechanism(s) of Cymbopogon citratus extracts was clarified through histopathological examination of brain tissues, estimation of AD biochemical markers, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in brain homogenates. In addition, antioxidant (using DPPH assay) and anticholinesterase (using modified Ellman's method) activities were investigated. Results: AlCl3-treated rats (17 mg/kg/day) showed histopathological alteration in brain tissues together with elevated levels of A beta, tau proteins, MDA, NF-kB and IL-6. However, treatment with AE and EE of Cymbopogon citratus leaves prevented the pathological changes and maintained the levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory markers. In addition, BAEE significantly inhibited acetylcholinesterase enzyme (2.11 +/- 0.11 mg/ml) and exhibited a strong antioxidant activity (24.99 +/- 0.00 mu g/ml). UPLC-MS of Cymbopogon citratus leaves showed peaks for twenty-eight compounds, twenty-one of them were identified. Three flavonoids; isoorientin, isoschaftoside and luteolin-7-O-neohesperidoside were isolated from BAEE as major constituents. The powdered leaves of Cymbopogon citratus was found to contain remarkable amounts of caffeic acid (3.49 mg/g dry wt.) and isoorientin (7.37 mg/g dry wt.) as determined by HPLC. Conclusion: Cymbopogon citratus ethanolic extract attenuates AlCl3-induced neurotoxicity in rats through inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammatory markers. This effect could possibly attributed, in part to its high content of phenolic acids and flavonoids. Accordingly, we recommend Cymbopogon citratus leaves for protection against AD.

A previous study showed that SQQX could reduce BP by decreasing levels of many inflammatory factors such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) and elevating peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) expression. However, a research focusing on SQQX's protection against HTN from a metabolomic perspective has never been done before. This study aimed to figure out the metabolic profiling variations due to oral administration of SQQX in spontaneous hypertensive rat (SHR) models and to find out the optimal dosage of SQQX. SHR in the intervention group orally received SQQX extract of three doses, namely, the low- (5.25 g/kg/d), middle- (10.5 g/kg/d), and high-dosage groups (21 g/kg/d) for 90 days. Rats were sacrificed at the end of the experiment, and their serum was collected for further examination. Serum metabolic profiling variations were analyzed using ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS). Results showed that dealing with SQQX remarkably decreased systolic blood pressure (SBP) of SHRs and the high-dosage group was with the best therapeutic effect where a total of 11 metabolites were markedly changed in contrast to the model group. Orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) score plot showed that the 5 groups of serum samples were divided into 5 categories, and the metabolic trajectory of the high-dosage SQQX group was inclined to move to the control group. Glycochenodeoxycholic acid, nicotinamide-N-oxide, and tryptophan betaine might be biomarkers that specifically marked the protective effects of SQQX against high BP mainly involving in cholesterol metabolism, primary bile acid biosynthesis, bile secretion, and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism. To conclude, SQQX has a protective effect on SHR, which may be partially correlated to restoration of perturbed metabolism in serum.

Objectives The aim of this study was to reveal and illustrate the metabolomic profile overlap found between these two diseases and describe the immunometabolomic significance. Methods Metabolic analyses using acid- and dansyl-labelled was performed on serum from adult patients with seropositive MG (n = 46), RA (n = 23) and healthy controls (n = 49) presenting to the University of Alberta Hospital specialty clinics. Chemical isotope labelling liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (CIL LC-MS) methods were utilized to assess the serum metabolome in patients; 12C/13C-dansyl chloride (DnsCl) was used to label amine/phenol metabolites and 12C/13C-p-dimethylaminophenacyl bromide (DmPA) was used for carboxylic acids. Metabolites matching our criteria for significance were selected if they were present in both groups. Multivariate statistical analysis [including principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis ( PLS-DA)] and biochemical pathway analysis was then conducted to gain understanding of the principal pathways involved in antibody-mediated pathogenesis. Results We found 20 metabolites dysregulated in both MG and RA when compared to healthy controls. Most prominently, observed changes were related to pathways associated with phenylalanine metabolism, tyrosine metabolism, ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis, and pyruvate metabolism. Conclusion From these results it is evident that many metabolites are common to humoral disease and exhibit significant immunometabolomic properties. This observation may lead to an enhanced understanding of the metabolic underpinnings common to antibody-mediated autoimmune disease. Further, contextualizing these findings within a larger clinical and systems biology context could provide new insights into the pathogenesis and management of these diseases.

In the present study, we intended to elucidate the antitumor efficacy of proxalutamide through the metabolomic profiling of PCa cells. Two AR-positive PCa cell lines and two AR-negative PCa cell lines were investigated. Cell viability assays based on ATP quantitation were conducted. LC-Q/TOF-MS was used to analyze intracellular metabolites before or after the administration of proxalutamide and two other clinical AR antagonists (bicalutamide and enzalutamide). The results of this study showed that the inhibitory effect of proxalutamide on PCa cell proliferation was better than that of bicalutamide and enzalutamide, and proxalutamide preferentially affected AR-positive PCa cells over AR-negative cells. The metabolic composition of PCa cells changed significantly after proxalutamide administration, and these changes in response to proxalutamide were significantly different from those in the presence of the two other AR antagonists. In AR-positive cells, proxalutamide significantly decreased the intracellular levels of glutamine, glutamate, glutathione, cysteine, glycine, aspartate, uridine, cytidine and thymidine. However, the effects of the two other antagonists on these discriminant metabolites were ambiguous, and no changes in these metabolites were found in AR-negative cells. Our findings indicate that proxalutamide has inhibitory effects on glutamine metabolism, redox homeostasis and de novo pyrimidine synthesis in AR-positive PCa cells that enhance the cellular sensitivity to proxalutamide.

Optimization of an Extraction Solvent for Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors from Hibiscus sabdariffa L. Based on Its UPLC-MS/MS Metabolic Profiling	MOLECULES			English	Article						ACE inhibition; Hibiscus; metabolomics; LC; MS; chemometry; extraction	PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; BLOOD-PRESSURE; HYPERTENSION; NIGERIANS; CAPACITY; COLD; HOT	Hibiscus species (Malvaceae) have been long used as an antihypertensive folk remedy. The aim of our study was to specify the optimum solvent for extraction of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibiting (ACEI) constituents from Hibiscus sabdariffa L. The 80% methanol extract (H2) showed the highest ACEI activity, which exceeds that of the standard captopril (IC50 0.01255 +/- 0.00343 and 0.210 +/- 0.005 mu g/mL, respectively). Additionally, in a comprehensive metabolomics approach, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to the high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS) method was used to trace the metabolites from each extraction method. Interestingly, our comprehensive analysis showed that the 80% methanol extract was predominated with secondary metabolites from all classes including flavonoids, anthocyanins, phenolic and organic acids. Among the detected metabolites, phenolic acids such as ferulic and chlorogenic acids, organic acids such as citrate derivatives and flavonoids such as kaempferol have been positively correlated to the antihypertensive potential. These results indicates that these compounds may significantly contribute synergistically to the ACE inhibitory activity of the 80% methanol extract.

In order to achieve premium quality with crop production, techniques involving the adjustment of nutrient supply and/or supplemental lighting with specific light quality have been applied. To examine the effects of low mineral supply and supplemental lighting, we performed non-targeted metabolite profiling of leaves and stems of the medicinal herb Perilla frutescens, grown under a lower (0.75x) and lowest (0.1x) supply of different minerals (N, K, or Mg) and under supplemental light-emitting diode (LED) lighting (red, blue, or red-blue combination). The lowest N supply increased flavonoids, and the lowest K or Mg slightly increased rosmarinic acid and some flavonoids in the leaves and stems. Supplemental LED lighting conditions (red, blue, or red-blue combination) significantly increased the contents of chlorophyll, most cinnamic acid derivatives, and rosmarinic acid in the leaves. LED lighting with either blue or the red-blue combination increased antioxidant activity compared with the control group without LED supplementation. The present study demonstrates that the cultivation of P. frutescens under low mineral supply and supplemental LED lighting conditions affected metabolic compositions, and we carefully suggest that an adjustment of minerals and light sources could be applied to enhance the levels of targeted metabolites in perilla.

However, comprehensive metrics and methods to evaluate and compare the data quality of global metabolomics data sets are lacking. In this work, we combine newly developed metrics, along with well-known measures, to comprehensively and quantitatively characterize the data quality across two similar liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) platforms, with the goal of providing an efficient and improved ability to evaluate the data quality in global metabolite profiling experiments. A pooled human serum sample was run 50 times on two high-resolution LC-QTOF-MS platforms to provide profile and centroid MS data. These data were processed using Progenesis QI software and then analyzed using five important data quality measures, including retention time drift, the number of compounds detected, missing values, and MS reproducibility (2 measures). The detected compounds were fit to a. distribution versus compound abundance, which was normalized to allow comparison of different platforms. To evaluate missing values, characteristic curves were obtained by plotting the compound detection percentage versus extraction frequency. To characterize reproducibility, the accumulative coefficient of variation (CV) versus the percentage of total compounds detected and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) versus compound abundance were investigated. Key findings include significantly better performance using profile mode data compared to centroid mode as well quantitatively better performance from the newer, higher resolution instrument. A summary table of results gives a snapshot of the experimental results and provides a template to evaluate the global metabolite profiling workflow. In total, these measures give a good overall view of data quality in global profiling and allow comparisons of data acquisition strategies and platforms as well as optimization of parameters.

We analyzed plasma samples from a nonrandomized controlled intervention study investigating the effect of partial enteral nutrition (PEN) on bone health and growth throughout one year with untargeted metabolomics using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Thirty-four paired samples from two time points (baseline and 12 months) were analyzed. Patients (median age: 13.9 years, range: 7-18.9 years, 44% females) were in remission or had mild disease activity. The intervention group received a casein-based formula for 12 months, providing ~25% of estimated daily energy requirements. Sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (splsda) was applied for group discrimination and identifying sources of variation to identify the impact of PEN. We also investigated the correlation of metabolites with inflammation markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and fecal calprotectin. After 12 months, our results show substantial difference between PEN and non-PEN groups in the metabolome of CD patients in remission or with mild disease activity. Inflammatory markers were associated with individual compounds and chemical classes such as isoprenoids and phospholipids. Identified compounds comprise metabolites produced by human or bacterial metabolism, as well as xenobiotics recognized as flavoring agents and environmental contaminants and their biotransformation products. Further longitudinal studies that also include patients with higher disease activity are warranted to evaluate the suitability of these metabolic biomarkers for predicting disease activity.

They can be absorbed from the intestine to the bloodstream or pass into the large intestine. Various bacterial species and enzymes are present along the entire intestine. The aim of the present work was to investigate the intestinal metabolism of selected dietary polyphenol and polyphenol glycosides (quercetin, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, cyanidin-3-O-galactoside, and delphinidin-3-O-galactoside) by human fecal bacteria. Moreover, the metabolism of metabolites formed from these compounds in human colon carcinoma cells (Cato-2) was also point of the interest. Test compounds were added to fresh human stool in broth or to Caco-2 cells in medium and then incubated for 6 or 20 h at 3TC. After incubation, samples were prepared for LC/MS determination. Main metabolic pathways were deglycosylation, hydrogenation, methylation, hydroxylation, and decomposition. 2.4.5-trihydroxybenzaldehyde, as a metabolite of cyanidin glycosides, was detected after incubation for the first time. Metabolites formed by fecal bacteria were further glucuronidated or methylated by intestinal enzymes. This metabolite profiling of natural compounds has helped to better understand the complex metabolism in the human intestine and this work also has shown the connection of metabolism of natural substances by intestinal bacteria followed by metabolism in intestinal cells.

Nutrient and Sensory Metabolites Profiling of Averrhoa Carambola L. (Starfruit) in the Context of Its Origin and Ripening Stage by GC/MS and Chemometric Analysis	MOLECULES			English	Article						primary metabolites; A; Carambola L; Oxalidaceae; GC-MS; SPME; volatiles; diabetes type-2	PALM FRUIT VARIETIES; SPME-GC-MS; ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY; VOLATILE COMPONENTS; C-GLYCOSIDES; OXALIC-ACID; ROOTS; OXALIDACEAE; CHROMATOGRAPHY; FLAVONOIDS	Averrhoa carambola L. is a tropical tree with edible fruit that grows at different climatic conditions. Despite its nutritive value and reported health benefits, it is a controversial fruit owing to its rich oxalate content. The present study aimed at investigating aroma and nutrient primary metabolites distribution in A. carambola fruits grown in Indonesia, Malaysia (its endemic origin) versus Egypt, and at different ripening stages. Two techniques were employed to assess volatile and non-volatile metabolites including headspace solid-phase micro-extraction (HS-SPME) joined with gas chromatography coupled with mass-spectrometry (GC-MS) and GC-MS post silylation, respectively. Twenty-four volatiles were detected, with esters amounting for the major class of volatiles in Egyptian fruit at ca. 66%, with methyl caproate as the major component, distinguishing it from other origins. In contrast, aldehydes predominated tropically grown fruits with the ether myristicin found exclusively in these. Primary metabolites profiling led to the identification of 117 metabolites viz. sugars, polyols and organic acids. Fructose (38-48%) and glucose (21-25%) predominated sugar compositions in ripe fruits, whereas sorbitol was the major sugar alcohol (2.4-10.5%) in ripe fruits as well. Oxalic acid, an anti-nutrient with potential health risks, was the major organic acid detected in all the studied fruits (1.7-2.7%), except the Malaysian one (0.07%). It increases upon fruit ripening, including considerable amounts of volatile oxalate esters detected via SPME, and which must not be omitted in total oxalate determinations for safety assessments.

Although possessing a broad spectrum of bioactivities, the metabolic characteristics of NF are inadequately unknown after oral gavage with this NF. The present study was performed to characterize its metabolism in vivo and in vitro. After NF oral gavage with mice, a total of 55 metabolites, containing 14 novel phase I metabolites and 18 novel phase II metabolites, were identified with high-resolution mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Recombinant enzyme screenings showed that multiple cytochrome P450s, two UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT1A4, UGT1A9), and several sulfotransferases (SULTs) participated in the metabolism of NF. In silico prediction and molecular docking of NF to the polymorphic enzymes (CYPs) provided additional support for the above experiments. This research details metabolic characteristics and provides an important reference basis for further application of NF.

However, due to the complexity of TCM ingredients, the current quality standards of TCM have problems that are difficult to guarantee clinical efficacy. American ginseng, the dried roots of Pawajc quinquefolium L. (Araliaceae), is a valuable herbal medicine due to various pharmacological effects and huge health benefit, which are associated with numerous active ingredients such as ginsenosides. Although a large number of studies have investigated the active ingredients of American ginseng, Q-markers reflecting comprehensive review on its efficacies has yet been unrevealed. Purpose: The study aims to discover the Q-markers of Panax quinquefolius (American ginseng), provides a powerful method to clarify the significant ingredents of TCM and help further discovering extensive quality evaluation model,contributing to a significant improvement of TCM quality standard. Methods: Mice general status, biochemical indexes assay, urine metabolic profile, and serum metabolic profile were utilized for model replication and efficacy evaluation. The in vitro and in vivo constituents of American ginseng using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) with Serum Pharmacochemistry of TCM were in-depth investigated. Q-markers that were associated with core markers of therapeutic effects were excavated by a plotting of correlation between marker metabolites and serum constituents (PCMS) approach. Results: Correlation analysis of 41 blood and urine labeled metabolites with 14 serum components showed that 24-methyl-7-cholesten-3 beta-ol, zizybeoside II, betulin, ginsenoside Rd, cinnamyl alcohol, pseudoginsenoside F11 is highly correlated with the therapeutic effects of Compound Zaofan Pill (CZP), while pseudoginsenoside F11 and ginsenoside Rd are highly correlated with the therapeutic effects of American ginseng. The six absorbed blood compounds can be considered as potential Q-markers for compound, of which two compounds, such as pseudoginsenoside F11 and ginsenoside Rd, can be considered as potential Q-markers for American ginseng. Conclusion: The study has demonstrated that the Chinmedomics is an effective, comprehensive and fire-new method for discovering the Q-markers of TCM, and it may be more reasonable choices to establish quality standards of TCM.

A total of 146 subgingival plaque samples and 50 gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples were collected from 24 patients with AgP and 10 periodontally healthy subjects (PH). Striking differences were observed in subgingival microbiome and GCF metabolomics between patients with AgP and PH, but not between samples with different probing depths (PDs). Metabolomics analysis combined with enrichment analysis showed that periodontitis significantly altered the concentration of compounds associated with biosynthesis of amino acids (e.g., alanine, leucine, isoleucine, and valine), galactose metabolism (e.g., myo-inositol, galactose, glucose, and hexitol), and pyrimidine metabolism (e.g., uracil, uridine, beta alanine, and thymine). Correlation analysis showed that the genera with significant difference between AgP and PH were usually significantly correlated with more metabolites, such as Aggregatibacter, Rothia, Peptostreptococcaceae_[XI][G-5], and Bacteroidaceae_[G-1]. While glucose and oxoproline had the most significant correlations with microorganisms. Our results revealed distinct microbial communities and metabolic profiles between AgP and PH. The significant correlation between microbial taxa and metabolites suggested the possible mechanisms for periodontitis. Our results also provided effective approaches for detecting periodontal disease and managing periodontitis.

A phytochemical study of N. multiglandulosa leaves was performed in order to obtain chemical information about secondary metabolites of this poorly studied species. The methanolic extract was purified by medium pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC) combined with semi preparative HPLC-PDA leading to the isolation of 16 compounds, including a new steroid named 5-hydroxypodecdysone B (13). The structure of the isolated compounds was determined by classical spectroscopic methods such as NMR and HRMS. Complementary F-19 NMR and UPLC-HRMS analysis did not detect the presence of monofluoracetate (MFA), a toxic compound previously described from this species.

Genetic deletion of gpr27 alters acylcarnitine metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and glucose homeostasis in zebrafish	FASEB JOURNAL			English	Article						carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; G protein-coupled receptors; insulin resistance; lipid metabolism; metabolomic profiling	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; THERAPEUTIC TARGETS; DIABETES-MELLITUS; DRUG DISCOVERY; BETA-OXIDATION; RESISTANCE; DISEASE; IDENTIFICATION; PROFILES; INSIGHTS	G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest group of membrane receptors in eukaryotic genomes and collectively they regulate nearly all cellular processes. Despite the widely recognized importance of this class of proteins, many GPCRs remain understudied. G protein-coupled receptor 27 (Gpr27) is an orphan GPCR that displays high conservation during vertebrate evolution. Although, GPR27 is known to be expressed in tissues that regulate metabolism including the pancreas, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue, its functions are poorly characterized. Therefore, to investigate the potential roles of Gpr27 in energy metabolism, we generated a whole body gpr27 knockout zebrafish line. Loss of gpr27 potentiated the elevation in glucose levels induced by pharmacological or nutritional perturbations. We next leveraged a mass spectrometry metabolite profiling platform to identify other potential metabolic functions of Gpr27. Notably, genetic deletion of gpr27 elevated medium-chain acylcarnitines, in particular C6-hexanoylcarnitine, C8-octanoylcarnitine, C9-nonanoylcarnitine, and C10-decanoylcarnitine, lipid species known to be associated with insulin resistance in humans. Concordantly, gpr27 deletion in zebrafish abrogated insulin-dependent Akt phosphorylation and glucose utilization. Finally, loss of gpr27 increased the expression of key enzymes in carnitine shuttle complex, in particular the homolog to the brain-specific isoform of CPT1C which functions as a hypothalamic energy senor. In summary, our findings shed light on the biochemical functions of Gpr27 by illuminating its role in lipid metabolism, insulin signaling, and glucose homeostasis.

To better understand these variants as potential therapeutic targets, we aimed to characterize their impact on metabolism using comprehensive metabolomics data from two population-based studies. A total of 9135 participants from the Fenland study and 9902 participants from the EPIC-Norfolk cohort were included in the study. We identified individuals with risk alleles associated with NASH-fibrosis: rs738409C>G in PNPLA3, rs58542926C>T in TM6SF2, rs641738C>T near MBOAT7, rs72613567TA>T in HSD17B13 and rs2642438A>G in MTARC1. Circulating levels of 1449 metabolites were measured using targeted and untargeted metabolomics. Associations between NASH-fibrosis variants and metabolites were assessed using linear regression. The specificity of variant-metabolite associations were compared to metabolite associations with ultrasound-defined steatosis, gene variants linked to liver fat (in GCKR, PPP1R3B and LYPLAL1) and gene variants linked to cirrhosis (in HFE and SERPINA1). Each NASH-fibrosis variant demonstrated a specific metabolite profile with little overlap (8/97 metabolites) comprising diverse aspects of lipid metabolism. Risk alleles in PNPLA3 and HSD17B13 were both associated with higher 3-methylglutarylcarnitine and three variants were associated with lower lysophosphatidylcholine C14:0. The risk allele in MTARC1 was associated with higher levels of sphingomyelins. There was no overlap with metabolites that associated with HFE or SERPINA1 variants. Our results suggest a link between the NASH-protective variant in MTARC1 to the metabolism of sphingomyelins and identify distinct molecular patterns associated with each of the NASH-fibrosis variants under investigation.

The presence of TDCPP in surface waters and aquatic organisms have been reported worldwide, yet the ecological risk of TDCPP on microalgae is rarely studied. We investigated the biotransformation of TDCPP and its toxicity on the microalga Scenedesmus obliquus using an untargeted metabolomics approach. Exposure to TDCPP resulted in a dose-response decrease of micoalgal biomass. In the presence of microalgae, TDCPP concentration in the media decreased by 25.3-40.6% after 5 days. TDCPP metabolites were identified in the media including hydrolysis and hydroxyl-substituted dechlorination products. A dose-response separation of metabolic profiles of microalgae was observed, with effect seen at the lowest concentration of 10 mu g/L tested, which is slightly higher than environmentally relevant concentrations. Differentiated metabolites identified include 52 lipids and 6 polar metabolites. Analysis of altered lipid pathways suggests that microalgal cells reinforce thylakoid membranes (function to protect photosynthesis) by compromising the integrity of plasma membrane (function to protect cellular substances) and extraplastidial cellular membranes. Changes in the polar metabolites might indicate osmotic stress and improved NO signaling after TDCPP exposure. Consistent with perturbation of membrane lipids, further experiment confirmed that exposure to 10 mg/L TDCPP resulted in significant (p < 0.01) plasma membrane damage. This study indicates biotransformation and the membrane damage toxicity mechanism of TDCPP on S. obliquus, demonstrating the usefulness of metabolomics for the toxicity mechanism elucidation of emerging pollutants.

(clary sage) was compared with N6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), kinetin (KIN) and thidiazuron (TDZ). mT was superior over all other cytokinin for not only shoot regeneration but also rooting. The highest shoot number (4.9 shoots/explants) was noted on nodal segments cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium including 2.0 mg/L mT and 0.2 mg/L indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). The regenerated shoots derived from mT including medium were rooted successfully on MS medium having 1.0 mg/L 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). Plantlets were successfully acclimatised (100%) and exhibited vigorous development in the greenhouse. The genetic stability of the propagated plants was assessed by start codon targeted polymorphism (SCoT) primers. A total variability of 3.13% was noted in the regenerants that revealed a high rated of genetic stability among the micropropagated plants. In addition, the secondary metabolite profiling of micropropagated plants was evaluated with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Although the hexane extracts of plants were dominated by n-alkanes, cytokinins added in the culture media altered their secondary metabolite contents. The protocol described here is a rapid and reliable micropropagation protocol for large-scale production of clonally stable clary sage plants for commercial purposes.

Because early diagnosis is difficult, ESCC is mostly diagnosed at an advanced stage, leading to a poor overall prognosis. The purpose of this study was to explore the differences between plasma metabolic profiles in ESCC patients and healthy controls and to establish a diagnostic model of ESCC. Methods: In this study, a cohort of 310 subjects, containing 140 ESCC patients and 170 healthy controls (HC), was recruited. Participants were randomly separated into a training set (80 ESCCs, 80 HCs) and a validation set (60 ESCCs, 90 HCs) and their plasma metabolomics profiles were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF/MS) technique. Univariate statistical analysis and multivariate analysis (MVA) methods were used to identify differential metabolites. Finally, the dysregulated pathways associated with ESCC were further explored and the diagnostic performance of the biomarker panel was evaluated. Results: Metabolic analyses identified 34 significant metabolites involved in the metabolism of amino acids, phospholipids, fatty acids, purine, and choline. Farthermore, an effective diagnostic model for ESCC was constructed based on eight metabolites. This panel of biomarkers consisted of hypoxanthine, proline betaine, indoleacrylic acid, inosine, 9-decenoylcarnitine, tetracosahexaenoic acid, LPE (20:4), and LPC (20:5). The model was verified and evaluated in the validation set. The AUC value of the ROC curve was 0.991(95% CI: 0.981-1.000, CI, Confidence interval), with a sensitivity (SE) of 98.8% and a specificity (SP) of 94.9% for the training set and 0.965(95% CI: 0.936-0.993), with a SE of 88.3% and a SP of 88.9% for the validation set. Among them, three biomarkers, indoleacrylic acid, LPC (20:5), and LPE (20:4), exhibited a trend associated with the ESCC progression. Conclusions: Our study identified a novel plasma biomarker panel, which clearly distinguishes ESCC patients and provides insight into the mechanisms of ESCC. This finding may form the basis for the development of a minimally invasive method for ESCC detection.

Plasma metabolomic profiles in liver cancer patients following stereotactic body radiotherapy	EBIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Hepatocellular carcinoma, Stereotactic body radiotherapy; Metabolomics; Biomarkers	FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA; BIOMARKERS; CIRRHOSIS	Background: Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is an effective treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study sought to identify differentially expressed plasma metabolites in HCC patients at baseline and early during SBRT, and to explore if changes in these metabolites early during SBRT may serve as biomarkers for radiation-induced liver injury and/or tumour response. Methods: Forty-seven HCC patients were treated with SBRT on previously published prospective trials. Plasma samples were collected at baseline and after one to two fractions of SBRT, and analysed by GC/MS and LC/MS for untargeted and targeted metabolomics profiling, respectively. Findings: Sixty-nine metabolites at baseline and 62 metabolites after one to two fractions of SBRT were differentially expressed, and strongly separated the Child Pugh (CP) B from the CP A HCC patients. These metabolites are associated with oxidative stress and alterations in hepatic cellular metabolism. Differential upregulation of serine, alanine, taurine, and lipid metabolites early during SBRT from baseline was noted in the HCC patients who demonstrated the greatest increase in CP scores at three months post SBRT, suggesting that high protein and lipid turnover early during SBRT may portend increased clinical liver toxicity. Twenty annotated metabolites including fatty acids, glycerophospholipids, and acylcarnitines were differentially upregulated early during SBRT from baseline and separated patients with complete/partial response from those with stable disease at three months post SBRT. Interpretation: Dysregulation of amino acid and lipid metabolism detected early during SBRT are associated with subsequent clinical liver injury and tumour response in HCC. (C) 2020 The Authors.

However, little is known about the effects of NTCP (SLC10A1) on hepatoblastoma (HB) and its underlying metabolic mechanisms. In this study, we found that NTCP (SLC10A1) expression was downregulated in HB cells and tissues, and it was demonstrated that NTCP (SLC10A1) reduced cell viability, promoted cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis of HB cells. The metabolic profiles of HB cells with NTCP (SLC10A1) overexpression were further examined to determine their biochemical alterations and deepen our understanding on the metabolic regulation of NTCP (SLC10A1) overexpression. The metabolomics study based on ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed alterations in the metabolites of HB cells following NTCP (SLC10A1) overexpression. Next, we stably overexpressed NTCP (SLC10A1) in HepG2 cells, and found that NTCP (SLC10A1)-overexpressing cells could inhibit the production of adenosine and decreased both mRNA and protein levels of HIF1 alpha. Further overexpression of HIF1 alpha in the NTCP (SLC10A1)-overexpression group restored the production of adenosine. Collectively, these findings provide strong evidence that NTCP (SLC10A1) overexpression significantly disrupts the metabolism of adenosine in HB cells and highlight that NTCP (SLC10A1) mediates adenosine production mainly through HIF1 alpha.

This review selected significant results which show the impact of lipidomic investigations for discriminating the metabolic profiles and dysregulation of metabolic pathways in CRC patient's comparative to healthy controls. It focuses on the description of best methods and procedures to separate and identify hydrophobic molecules with molecular weights under 1000 Daltons, especially using high pressure liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The main lipid classes involved in the onset and progression of CRC are presented, as well the alterations of lipid-related cellular pathways during tumorigenesis. Especially lipid profile changes (of cerotic acid, hydroxylated, polyunsaturated fatty acids, free fatty acids, oxylipins, glycerophospholipids, di- and triglycerides, sphingomyelins and ceramides) showed significant differences and can be considered reliable biomarkers to discriminate between early and advanced stages of CTC malignancy, prognosis or survival prediction.

Methods: In this prospective cohort study, scrum samples obtained from patients at risk of AMI (n = 112) and non-risk controls (n = 89) were tested using high-resolution metabolomics (HRM). Partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), along with univariate analysis using a false discovery rate (FDR) of q = 0.05 were performed to discriminate metabolic profiles and to determine significantly different metabolites between healthy control and AMI risk groups. Results: PLS-DA significantly separated the AMI risk sera from control sera. The metabolites associated with amino acid biosynthesis, 2-oxocarboxylic add, ttyptophan, and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism pathways were mainly elevated in patients at risk of AMI. Further validation and quantification by MS/MS showed that tryptophan, camitine, L-homocysteine sulfinic acid (L-HCSA), and cysteic acid (CA) were upregulated, while L-cysteine and L-cysteine sulfinic acid (L-CSA) were downregulated, specifically among AMI risk sera. Additionally, these discriminant metabolic profiles were not related to hypertension, smoking or alcoholism. Conclusion: In conclusion, detecting upregulated L-HCSA and CA along with camitine among patients at risk for AMI could serve as promising non-invasive biomarkers for early AMI detection.

In this study, the widely targeted metabolomics approach was used to analyze the metabolic profiles of heartwood and sapwood in the red-heart Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata), with an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry system. A total of 224 secondary metabolites were detected in the heartwood and sapwood, and of these, flavonoids and phenolic acids accounted for 36% and 26% of the components, respectively. The main pathways appeared to be differentially activated, including those for the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids and flavonoids. Moreover, we observed highly significant accumulation of naringenin chalcone, dihydrokaempferol, pinocembrin, hesperetin, and other important secondary metabolites in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. Our results provide insight into the flavonoid pathway associated with wood color formation in Chinese fir that will be useful for further breeding programs.

In particular, Allium sativum L. (garlic), the most economically important Allium species, is known to present volatile, comparatively polar sulfur-containing compounds responsible for both the typical garlic aroma and antimicrobial property. More recently, the (moderately) polar portion of garlic metabolome, rich of polyphenols and amino acids, is gaining increasing interest as a source of antioxidants and primary nutrients. In this study, we have explored the chemical diversity of eight different hydroalcoholic extracts obtained by microwave-assisted extraction of white and red crop A. sativum and wild Allium triquetrum, Allium roseum, and Allium ampeloprasum, all originating from the Mediterranean Basin. The aim is to appraise their potential dietetic and healing value through an in-depth chemical characterization and contribute to preserve and exploit natural resources. The multimethodological method applied here is based on an untargeted metabolic profiling by means of high-resolution electrospray ionization Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (ESI FT-ICR) mass spectrometry. More than 850 by ESI(+) and 450 by ESI(-) putative metabolites have been annotated covering all main classes of primary and secondary metabolites, including amino acids, alkaloids, organic and fatty acids, nucleotides, vitamins, organosulfur compounds, and flavonoids. The pigment and polyphenol components have been separated and quantified by a targeted chromatographic high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detector (HPLC-PDA) and CIEL*a*b* colorimetric assay, showing characteristic yellow and red components in each extract, related to a different milieu of anthocyanins and flavonoids as assigned by high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS).

The aim of our study was to assess the correlation between metabolic profiles and CV-AEs in CML patients treated with TKIs. Methods: We investigated 39 adult CML patients in chronic-phase (mean age 49 years, range 24-70 years), with no comorbidities evidenced at baseline, who were consecutively identified with CML and treated with imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, and ponatinib. All patients performed Gas-Chromatography-Mass-Spectrometry-based metabolomic analysis and were divided into two groups (with and without CV-AEs). Results: Ten CV-AEs were documented. Seven CV-AEs were rated as 3 according to the Common Toxicity Criteria, and one patient died of a dissecting aneurysm of the aorta. The patients' samples were clearly separated into two groups after analysis and the main discriminant metabolites were tyrosine, lysine, glutamic acid, ornithine, 2-piperdinecarboxylic acid, citric acid, proline, phenylalanine, threonine, mannitol, leucine, serine, creatine, alanine, and 4-hydroxyproline, which were more abundant in the CV-AE group. Conversely, myristic acid, oxalic acid, arabitol, 4-deoxy rithronic acid, ribose, and elaidic acid were less represented in the CV-AE group. Conclusions: CML patients with CV-AEs show a different metabolic profile, suggesting probable mechanisms of endothelial damage.

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to identify potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis of GCA. Global metabolic profiles were obtained from plasma samples collected from 21 patients with GCA and 48 healthy controls using ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The orthogonal partial least squares discrimination analysis model was applied to distinguish patients with GCA from healthy controls and to identify potential biomarkers. Metabolic pathway analysis was performed using MetaboAnalyst (version 4.0) and revealed that 'glycerophospholipid metabolism', linoleic acid metabolism', 'fatty acid biosynthesis' and 'primary bile acid biosynthesis' were significantly associated with GCA. In addition, an early diagnostic model for GCA was established based on the relative levels of four key biomarkers, including phosphorylcholine, glycocholic acid, L-acetylcarnitine and arachidonic acid. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve revealed that the diagnostic model had a sensitivity and specificity of 0.977 and 0.952, respectively. The present study demonstrated that metabolomics may aid the identification of the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of GCA. In addition, the proposed diagnostic method may serve as a promising approach for the early diagnosis of GCA.

However, the in vivo substances of Periplocae Cortex remain unknown yet. In this study, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used for profiling the chemical components and related metabolites of Periplocae Cortex. A total of 98 constituents were identified or tentatively characterized in Periplocae Cortex: 42 C21 steroidal glycosides, 10 cardiac glycosides, 23 organic acids, 4 aldehydes, 7 triterpenes, and 12 other types. Among them, 18 components were unambiguously identified by comparison with reference standards. In addition, 176 related xenobiotics (34 prototypes and 142 metabolites) were screened out and characterized in rats' biosamples (plasma, urine, bile, and feces) after the oral administration of Periplocae Cortex. Moreover, the metabolic fate of periplocoside S-4a, a C21 steroidal glycoside, was proposed for the first time. In summary, phase II reactions (methylation, glucuronidation, and sulfation), phase I reactions (hydrolysis reactions, oxygenation, and reduction), and their combinations were the predominant metabolic reactions of Periplocae Cortex in rat. It is the first report to reveal the in vivo substances and metabolism feature of Periplocae Cortex. This study also provided meaningful information for further pharmacodynamics study of Periplocae Cortex, as well as its quality control research.

Biomarkers of bone mineral density (BMD) are helpful for prevention and early diagnosis of osteoporosis. This study aims to identify metabolomic biomarkers of low BMD. Methods: We included 701 participants who had BMD measures by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans and donated fasting plasma samples from three clinical centres as a discovery set and another 278 participants from the fourth centre as an independent replication set. We used a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach to profile the global metabolites of fasting plasma. Findings: Among the 265 named metabolites identified in our study, six were associated with low BMD (FDR-adjusted P<0.05) in the discovery set and were successfully validated in the independent replication set. The circulating levels of five metabolites, i.e., inosine, hypoxanthine, PC (0-18:0/22:6), SM (d18:1/21:0) and isoleucyl-proline were associated with decreased odds of low BMD, and PC (16:0/18:3) level was associated with increased odds of low BMD. Per 1-SD increase in a composite metabolite score of these six metabolites was associated with about half decreased odds of low BMD (odds ratio 0.59, 95% confidence interval: 0.52-0.68). Furthermore, introduction of a panel of metabolites selected by elastic net regression to a prediction model of classical risk factors and plasma biomarker of bone resorption substantially improved the prediction performance for low BMD (ADCs: 0.782 vs. 0.698, P=0.002).

Three novel species (D. flavogranulata,D. phadaengensis, andD. chiangdaoensis) were recognized from a molecular phylogeny based on concatenated ITS, LSU,RPB2, andTUB2sequence data, combined with morphological characters and secondary metabolite profiles based on high performance liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detection and mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). The major components detected were cytochalasins (inD. flavogranulataandD. chiangdaoensis) and daldinin type azaphilones (inD.phadaengensis). In addition,D. brachysperma, which had hitherto only been reported from America, was found for the first time in Asia. Its phylogenetic affinities were studied, confirming previous suspicions from morphological comparisons that the species is closely related toD. eschscholtziiandD. bambusicola, both common in Thailand.Daldinia flavogranulata,one of the new taxa,was found to be closely related to the same taxa. The other two novel species,D. phadaengensisandD. chiangdaoensis, share characters withD. korfiiandD. kretzschmarioides, respectively.

A better understanding of the response mechanisms of plant reproductive organs to stress induced by B deficiency and surplus could provide new insights to potential strategies for improving seed yield and quality. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the mechanisms of tolerance to B-induced stress in the reproductive organs of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L. cv. 'Aohan'). We initially used five B concentrations (0 mg B L-1, 400 mg B L-1, 800 mg B L-1, 1200 mg B L-1, and 1600 mg B L-1) to determine the B deficient, sufficient, and surplus levels in the field. Secondly, we examined changes in metabolite profiles of alfalfa 'Aohan' reproductive organs in response to B deficiency (0 mg B L-1), B sufficiency (800 mg B L-1), and B surplus (1600 mg B L-1) conditions using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Flowers and seeds from alfalfa 'Aohan' showed different metabolite profiles and resistance capacity under B deficiency and surplus conditions. B deficiency led to the excessive accumulation of sugars and phenolic compounds in alfalfa 'Aohan' and seeds, respectively, thus causing abscission or the abortion of reproductive organs. In contrast, B surplus severely reduced the levels of metabolites associated with amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, resulting in the flowers falling and, therefore, low seed yield. Overall, B deficiency predominantly reduced seed yield and quality of alfalfa 'Aohan', while B surplus mainly affected seed yield of alfalfa 'Aohan'.

Effects of feeding aLactobacillus plantarum JL01diet on caecal bacteria and metabolites of weaned piglets	LETTERS IN APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						16S rDNA; caecal bacteria; Lactobacillus plantarum JL01; metabolites; weaned piglets	ENTEROTOXIGENIC ESCHERICHIA-COLI; SULFATE-REDUCING BACTERIA; GUT MICROBIOTA; LACTOBACILLUS-PLANTARUM; PANTOEA-AGGLOMERANS; TRYPTOPHAN-METABOLISM; DISTAL GUT; SULFIDE; PIG; ACID	Currently, knowledge is limited concerning the impact of aLactobacillus plantarum JL01diet for weaned piglets on caecal bacteria and metabolite profiles. In our experiments, 24 weaned piglets were randomly divided into two groups; each piglet in the treatment groups (Cec-Lac) was fed a basic diet and administered 10 ml ofL. plantarum JL01(1 center dot 0 x 10(9) CFU per ml) every day. The control group (Cec-Con) was fed a basic diet. After feeding for 28 days, we analysed the parameters of the caecal digesta of weaned piglets. We used 16S rDNA gene sequencing and mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics techniques to investigate the effect of aL. plantarum JL01diet on intestinal microbial composition and its metabolite profiles in the caecum contents of weaned piglets. The results showed that the richness estimators (ACE and Chao indices) in the caecal bacteria increased in the Cec-Lacgroup.Prevotella_2andDesulfovibriodecreased significantly, whilePantoeaandRectale_groupincreased in the caecum of weaned piglets in the Cec-Lacgroup. Furthermore, Pearson's correlation analysis revealed that the genusRectale_groupwas positively correlated with indole-3-acetic acid (P 0 center dot 05), and the genusPantoeahad the same correlation with 1-palmitoyl lysophosphatidic acid. The metabolomics analysis revealed that theL. plantarum JL01diet supplementation had significant effects on tryptophan metabolism and fat digestion and absorption. The results indicated that theL. plantarum JL01dietary supplementation not only altered the microbial composition but also mediated tryptophan metabolism and fat digestion and absorption in the caecum, factors that may further affect the health of the host.

Structure elucidation was achieved using spectroscopic techniques, including 1D and 2D NMR and HRMS. The bioactive extract's metabolomic profiling showed the existence of various secondary metabolites, mainly oleanane-type saponins, phenolic diterpenes, and lupane triterpenes. The in vitro cytotoxic activity of the isolated compounds was tested against two human cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and HepG2. Both compounds, 1 and 2, displayed strong cytotoxicity against the MCF-7 cell line, with IC50 values at 21.1 +/- 0.17 mu M and 27.5 +/- 0.18 mu M, respectively. They likewise showed a promising activity against HepG2 with IC50 at 36.8 +/- 0.16 mu M for 1 and IC50 30.5 +/- 0.23 mu M for 2 compared to the standard drug cisplatin. Molecular docking experiments showed that 1 and 2 displayed high affinity to the SET protein and to inhibitor 2 of protein phosphatase 2A (I2PP2A), which could be a possible mechanism for their cytotoxic activity. This paper spreads light on the role of these metabolites in holding fouling organisms away from the outer surface of the sponge, and the potential use of these defensive molecules in the production of novel anticancer agents.

Methods: We analyzed metabolic variations concomitant to five different maturation stages of GBs including immature green (IG), mature green (MG), partially red (PR), fully red (FR), and overmature red (OR) using mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomic profiling and multivariate analyses. Results: The partial least squares discriminant analysis score plot based on gas chromatography-MS datasets highlighted metabolic disparity between preharvest (IG and MG) and harvest/postharvest (PR, FR, and OR) GB extracts along PLS1 (34.9%) with MG distinctly segregated across PLS2 (18.2%). Forty-three significantly discriminant primary metabolites were identified encompassing five developmental stages (variable importance in projection > 1.0, p < 0.05). Among them, most amino acids, organic acids, 5-C sugars, ethanolamines, purines, and palmitic acid were detected in preharvest GB extracts, whereas 6-C sugars, phenolic acid, and oleamide levels were distinctly higher during later maturation stages. Similarly, the partial least squares discriminant analysis based on liquid chromatography-MS datasets displayed preharvest and harvest/postharvest stages clustered across PLS1 (11.1 %); however, MG and PR were separated from IG, FR, and OR along PLS2 (5.6 %). Overall, 24 secondary metabolites were observed significantly discriminant (variable importance in projection > 1.0, p < 0.05), with most displaying higher relative abundance during preharvest stages excluding ginsenosides Rg1 and Re. Furthermore, we observed strong positive correlations between total flavonoid and phenolic metabolite contents in GB extracts and antioxidant activity. Conclusion: Comprehending the dynamic metabolic variations associated with GB maturation stages rationalize their optimal harvest time per se the related agroeconomic traits.

J	Messa, GM; Napolitano, F; Elsea, SH; di Bernardo, D; Gao, X				Messa, Gian Marco; Napolitano, Francesco; Elsea, Sarah H.; di Bernardo, Diego; Gao, Xin			A Siamese neural network model for the prioritization of metabolic disorders by integrating real and simulated data	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	19th European Conference on Computational Biology (ECCB)	SEP 07-08, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK				INBORN-ERRORS; GLOBAL RECONSTRUCTION; SEMANTIC SIMILARITY; DIAGNOSIS; VIEW	Motivation: Untargeted metabolomic approaches hold a great promise as a diagnostic tool for inborn errors of metabolisms (IEMs) in the near future. However, the complexity of the involved data makes its application difficult and time consuming. Computational approaches, such as metabolic network simulations and machine learning, could significantly help to exploit metabolomic data to aid the diagnostic process. While the former suffers from limited predictive accuracy, the latter is normally able to generalize only to IEMs for which sufficient data are available. Here, we propose a hybrid approach that exploits the best of both worlds by building a mapping between simulated and real metabolic data through a novel method based on Siamese neural networks (SNN). Results: The proposed SNN model is able to perform disease prioritization for the metabolic profiles of IEM patients even for diseases that it was not trained to identify. To the best of our knowledge, this has not been attempted before. The developed model is able to significantly outperform a baseline model that relies on metabolic simulations only. The prioritization performances demonstrate the feasibility of the method, suggesting that the integration of metabolic models and data could significantly aid the IEM diagnosis process in the near future.

Here, we aimed to assess the impact of maternal calorie restriction during lactation on milk composition to identify potential candidate components that could be involved in the programming effects in offspring. Methods An untargeted metabolomic approach in milk samples from 20%-calorie-restricted lactating (CRL) dams and their controls was performed. Levels of leptin, adiponectin, and irisin hormones in milk were also determined at lactating days 5, 10, and 15. Results Metabolomic analyses revealed a different metabolite pattern in milk between controls and CRL dams. 29 differential metabolites were tentatively identified (p < 0.05, FC > 1.5). Among them, myo-inositol, which showed greater levels in milk from CRL rats than controls, may be highlighted as one of the biologically plausible candidates that could be related to the beneficial effects of CRL in offspring. Results regarding myo-inositol were validated spectrophotometrically at days 10 and 15 of lactation, and levels in milk were correlated with maternal plasma levels. In addition, milk from CRL dams presented increased levels of adiponectin, decreased levels of irisin, and no changes in leptin levels vs controls throughout lactation. Conclusion These data reveal important changes in milk composition due to calorie restriction during lactation that may be involved in the metabolic programming of the healthier phenotype of adult offspring. However, the possible contribution of the specific components is yet to be determined.

We previously reported that the red carrot cell line R4G accumulates high levels of anthocyanins, which are potent antioxidants with multiple health-promoting properties. To investigate the industrial potential of this cell line in detail, we tested extract for antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity in the mouse monocyte/macrophage cell-line J774A.1 and in reconstructed skin tissue models. We also compared the R4G extract to commercial carrot extracts in terms of stability and metabolomic profiles. We found that the R4G extract have potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, protecting mammalian cells from the oxidative stress triggered by exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharides and H2O2. The extract also inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B in an epidermal skin model, and induced the expression of VEGF-A to promote the microcirculation in a dermal microtissue model. The anthocyanins extracted from R4G cells were significantly more stable than those found in natural red carrot extracts. Finally, we showed that R4G extract has similar metabolomic profile of natural extracts by using a combination of targeted and untargeted metabolomics analysis, demonstrating the safety of R4G carrot cells for applications in the nutraceutical and food/feed industries.

In this study, we focused on high-temperature culture. First, we examined the thermotolerance of 3160 actinomycete strains from our laboratory culture collection and selected 57 thermotolerant actinomycetes that grew well at 45 degrees C. These 57 thermotolerant actinomycetes were cultured for 5 days in liquid medium at both 30 degrees C and 45 degrees C. Culture broths were extracted with 1-butanol, and each extract was subjected to LC/MS analysis. The metabolic profiles of each strain were compared between the 30 degrees C and 45 degrees C cultures. We found that almost half of these thermotolerant actinomycetes produced secondary metabolites that were detected only in the 45 degrees C culture. This result suggests that high-temperature culture induces the production of dormant secondary metabolites. These compounds were named "heat shock metabolites (HSMs)." To examine HSM production in more detail, 18 strains were selected at random from the initial 57 strains and cultivated in six different media at 30 degrees C and 45 degrees C; as before, metabolic profiles of each strain in each medium were compared between the 30 degrees C and 45 degrees C cultures. From this analysis, we found a total of 131 HSMs. We identified several angucycline-related compounds as HSMs from two thermotolerant Streptomyces species. Furthermore, we discovered a new compound, murecholamide, as an HSM from thermotolerant Streptomyces sp. AY2. We propose that high-temperature culture of actinomycetes is a convenient method for activating dormant secondary metabolite biosynthetic genes.

However, the potentially metabolic mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to investigate the hepatopancreatic metabolic profiles of twenty giant freshwater prawns between the fast-growing group and slow-growing group. In the metabolomics assay, we isolated 8,293 peaks in positive and negative iron mode. Subsequently, 44 significantly differential metabolites were identified. Functional pathway analysis revealed that these metabolites were significantly enriched in three key metabolic pathways. Further integrated analysis indicated that glycerophospholipid metabolism and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis have significant impact on growth performance in M.rosenbergii. Our findings presented here demonstrated the critical metabolites and metabolic pathways involved in growth performance, moreover provided strong evidence for elucidating the potentially metabolic mechanism of the unsynchronized growth in M. rosenbergii.

The chemical lipophilic profile of bothS. maritimaandP. maritimais herein reported for the first time. Through the accomplished data, it is possible to conclude that these species are rich in essential compounds that can be relevant to endorse their use as nutraceuticals. Furthermore, through a principal component analysis, a clear differentiation between the taxa was achieved, which indicates that their response to salinity stress is different. That fact was confirmed by the pathway enrichment analysis, which showed that the induced changes in metabolic pathways vary in each species.	[Faustino, Maria V.; Faustino, Maria A.

(Malvaceae) is one of the well-known traditionally used remedy worldwide. It exhibited numerous pharmacological properties including antioxidant, antidepressant, sedative, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, antimicrobial and neuroprotective activities. The aim of this study is to highlight the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of anthocyanin-enriched extracts of two Hibiscus varieties (white and red calyces) in the management of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in addition to their metabolic profiling. The anthocyanin contents were determined quantitatively using the pH-differential technique and qualitatively by LC/MS/MS. The extracts were tested in vitro for their antioxidant potential as well as acetylcholinesterase inhibition activity and both showed promising activities. The LC/MS/MS analysis allowed the tentative identification of 26 and 24 metabolites in red and white calyces, respectively, represented by anthocyanins, flavonoids, aliphatic and phenolic acids. In vivo, streptozotocin induced AD in mice model was established and Hibiscus extracts were tested at a dose of 200 mg kg(-1) compared to celecoxib (30 mg/kg). Histopathology of cerebral cortex and hippocampus, immunohistochemistry for tau- protein and caspase-3 with behavioral tests and measurement of several biochemical parameters were done. Hibiscus prevented memory impairment, and this could be attributed to the amelioration of STZ-induced neuroinflammation and amyloidogenesis. Consequently, Hibiscus represents a promising safe agent that can be repurposed for AD through exerting anti-inflammatory, anti-acetylcholinesterase, antioxidant, and anti-amyloidogenic activities.

This is the first report on metabolites profiling and biochemical activities of these plant species. Our results revealed that L. mehrae, P. benthamii, and R. auriculata are rich source of bioactive secondary metabolites and have good antioxidant potential. The methanol extract of L. mehrae, P. benthamii, and R. auriculata showed substantial inhibitory potential towards elastase, whereas water extract of L. mehrae and R. auriculata were more strong inhibitors of tyrosinase. Among the three plants, P. benthamii showed noteworthy inhibition on alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase, lipase, tyrosinase, elastase, and cholinesterases enzymes. High resolution mass spectrometry analysis revealed the presence of metabolites such as Protocatechuic acid, Gallic acid, 7,8,3 ',4 '-tetrahydroxyflavanone, Rhamnocitrin, Quercetin, Hyperoside, Quercetin-7-glucoside, Rutin, Rhamnetin, Aromadendrin, Camphor, and Hexanoic acid in L. mehrae. Moreover, Catechin and Fisetin were present in P. benthamii and Kaempferide, 7,8,3 ',4 '-Tetrahydroxyflavone, 5,7-Dihydroxy-2,3-dihydroflavonol 3-acetate, and Aromadendrin were present in R. auriculata.

Untargeted Metabolomic Approach Shows No Differences in Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue of Diabetic and Non-Diabetic Subjects Undergoing Bariatric Surgery: An Exploratory Study	BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH FOR NURSING			English	Article						obesity; diabetes (T2DM); subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT); untargeted metabolomics; insulin resistance (IR); bariatric surgery	INSULIN-RESISTANCE; OBESITY; 1,5-ANHYDROGLUCITOL; SECRETION; DISEASE; WEIGHT; DEPOTS; RISK	Background: Obesity plays a major role in the development of insulin resistance (IR) and diabetes (T2DM). Increased adipose tissue (AT) is particularly of interest because it activates a chronic inflammatory response in adipocytes and other tissues. AT plays key endocrine and metabolic functions, acting in the regulation of insulin sensitivity and energy homeostasis. Additionally, it can be easily collected during bariatric surgery. The purpose of this pilot study was to explore the potential differences in AT metabolism, through comparing the untargeted metabolomic profiles of diabetic and non-diabetic obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Methods: For this exploratory study, samples were collected from 17 subjects. Subcutaneous AT (SAT) samples from obese-diabetic (n = 8) and Obese-non-Diabetic (n = 9) subjects were obtained from the Human Metabolic Tissue Bank. Untargeted metabolomic profiling was performed by Metabolon (R) Inc. Statistical analysis was performed using the MetaboAnalyst 4.0 platform. Results: Among the 421 metabolites identified and analyzed there were no significant differences between the Obese-Diabetics and the Obese-non-Diabetics. Small changes were observed by fold change analysis mainly in lipid (n = 12; e.g. NEFAs) and amino acid (n = 8; e.g. BCAAs) metabolic pathways. Dysregulation of these metabolites has been associated with IR and other T2DM-related pathophysiological processes. Conclusion: Obesity may influence SAT metabolism masking T2DM-dependent dysregulation. Better understanding the metabolic differences within SAT in diabetic populations may help identify potential biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring of T2DM in patients undergoing bariatric surgery.

IMI was found to be neurotoxic and hepatotoxic. In the present study, the effects of repeated oral administration of two doses of IMI (5 and 20 mg/kg/day) for 28 days on hippocampus and liver of female KM mice were studied. The histopathological and biochemical experiments indicated obvious damages to the hippocampus and liver of mice in the high-dose group (20 mg/kg/day). Using a high-throughput metabolomics platform based on ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography/hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF MS), we studied effects of IMI on metabolic profiles in the hippocampus and liver of mice. Significant differences among the control group, the low-dose group and the high-dose group were clearly presented using multivariate analysis. The changed metabolic profile in the low-dose group (5 mg/kg/day) revealed that the metabolic disturbance in the hippocampus and liver of mice had been induced by low-dose of IMI, although no significant histopathological changes were observed in the low-dose group. Six differential metabolites in the hippocampus and 10 differential metabolites in the liver were identified as the possible biomarkers to distinguish IMI exposure from the control group using the variable importance in projection (VIP) value and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The metabolism disturbances of important biochemical pathways in the hippocampus and liver of mice in the exposed groups were elucidated, mostly concentrated in lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and energy metabolism (p < 0.05). Such investigations give out a global view of IMI-induced damages in the hippocampus and liver of mice and imply a health risk associated with early metabolic damage in mice.

Enhanced glutaminolysis is a hallmark of cancer metabolism which fulfills these needs. Two glutamine transporters, SLC1A5 and SLC38A2, have been previously reported to promote glutaminolysis in cancer with controversial perspectives. In this study, we harnessed the proximity labeling reaction to map the protein interactome using mass spectrometry-based proteomics and discovered a potential protein-protein interaction between SLC1A5 and SLC38A2. The SLC1A5/SLC38A2 interaction was further confirmed by bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay. We further investigated the metabolic influence of SLC1A5 and SLC38A2 overexpression in human cells, respectively, and found that only SLC38A2, but not SLC1A5, resulted in a cancer-like metabolic profile, where the intracellular concentrations of essential amino acids and lactate were significantly increased as quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Finally, we analyzed the 5-year survival rates in a large pan-cancer cohort and found that the SLC1A5(hi)/SLC38A2(lo)group did not relate to a poor survival rate, whereas the SLC1A5(lo)/SLC38A2(hi)group significantly aggravated the lethality. Intriguingly, the SLC1A5(hi)/SLC38A2(hi)group resulted in an even worse prognosis, suggesting a cooperative effect between SLC1A5 and SCL38A2. Our data suggest that SLC38A2 plays a dominant role in reprogramming the cancer-like metabolism and promoting the cancer progression, whereas SLC1A5 may augment this effect when co-overexpressed with SLC38A2. We propose a model to explain the relationship between SLC1A5, SLC38A2 and SCL7A5, and discuss their impact on glutaminolysis and mTOR signaling.

Metabolite profiling of onion landraces and the cold storage effect	PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Allium cepa L.; Landraces; Targeted and untargeted metabolomics; GC x GC-MS; Cold storage; Amino acids; Sugars	ALLIUM-CEPA L.; LONG-TERM STORAGE; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; PYRUVIC-ACID; AMINO-ACIDS; BULBS; QUALITY; FRUCTANS; CULTIVAR; HARVEST	Today, commercial onion breeders focus almost entirely on conventional farming which reduces diversity in the market and leads to loss of desirable traits such as those that impact nutritional and sensory aspects of onions. A way to preserve phenotypic and genetic diversity is to re-evaluate traditional landraces to introduce their benefits to the broader public. Common onion genotypes vary greatly in their storability. In particular, temperature and relative humidity during storage have significant impact on the metabolites in onions after storage. The aim of this study was to assess changes in the metabolite profile of ten onion genotypes after five months of cold storage. In addition, a characterization of onion landraces in their fresh state was also conducted in order to compare their properties against a commercial genotype. Onion genotypes were grown under organic farming conditions. After harvest and curing, bulbs were stored for up to 22 weeks. Before and after storage, bulb samples were analyzed through targeted and untargeted methods. Out of 189 identified metabolites, 128 showed a storage effect. Mainly fructans decreased because of respiration and energy demand, while monosaccharides increased. Further, amino acids were altered in their concentration after storage with an effect on aroma precursors. Eight of the nine landraces had good storability without critical losses. In their fresh state, the onion genotypes clustered into three major groups. For instance, landraces of group III showed consistently and substantially higher levels of amino acids and certain sugars, indicating a high potential of aromatic properties in those onion landraces.

Leaf metabolic profiles of two soybean genotypes differentially affect the survival and the digestibility of Anticarsia gemmatalis caterpillars	PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Insect resistance; Soybean breeding; LC/MS profiles; Flavonoids; Methylquercetin pathway; Phytohormonal response	HELICOVERPA-ARMIGERA; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; HEMIPTERA-PENTATOMIDAE; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; INDUCED RESISTANCE; NEZARA-VIRIDULA; JASMONIC ACID; PLANT DEFENSE; CROP LOSSES; LEPIDOPTERA	Insect pests such as Anticarsia gemmatalis cause defoliation and yield losses. Soybean breeding has obtained resistant genotypes, however the mechanism remains unknown. Studies indicated the presence of deterrents compounds in the resistant genotype IAC17, and their leaf metabolite profiles were compared to the susceptible genotype UFV105, which was elicited or not by caterpillar infestation. Cluster analysis indicated a significative distinction between these profiles as well as differences in plant defense pathways. Methylquercetins were constitutively present in the largest concentrations, specifically in the IAC17. Relationship between the resistance and the levels of phytohormones jasmonic acid, abscisic acid and salicylic acid was not observed. However, 1-aminocyclopropane-1 carboxylic acid levels indicated that the ethylene may be involved in the constitutive biosynthesis of bioactive compounds. Extracts were added to the diets at three different concentrations to evaluate the effect on caterpillar survival. Lowest survival rates were observed when extracts from the resistant IAC17 were used, at the lowest concentrations. Survival rates were not higher when IAC17 infested by caterpillars were used. On the other hand, when extracts from the susceptible were used, the survival reductions were only observed in the highest extract concentrations. These supplementations of the diet reduced the digestive capacity, agreeing with the proteolytic activities, whereas malformations of the intestinal cells were dose dependent. The inhibitory effects persisted in higher dilutions only for the IAC17. Constitutive resistance was also explained by higher levels of protease inhibition. These results can be useful to elucidate the genes and cascades controlling the resistance.	[Gomez, Jenny D.; Pinheiro, Valquiria J.

Herein, differences of MS signals in specific time courses after water deficit stress and control cases without any timing period were distinguished significantly by common pattern recognition techniques, i.e., PCA, HCA-Heatmap, and PIS-DA. Subsequently, the results were compared with supervised Kohonen neural network (SKN) ones as a non-linear data visualization and capable mapping tool. The classification models showed excellent performance to predict the level of drought stress. By assessing variances contribution on the PCA-loadings of the MS data, the discriminant variables related to the most critical metabolites were identified and then confirmed by ANOVA. Indeed, FTICR MS-based multivariate analysis strategy could explore distinctive metabolites and metabolic pathways/profiles, grouped into three metabolism categories including amino acids, carbohydrates (i.e., galactose, glucose, fructose, sucrose, and mannose), and other metabolites (rosmarinic acid and citrate), to indicate biological mechanisms in response to drought stress for thyme. It was achieved and approved through the MS signals, genomics databases, and transcriptomics factors to interpret and predict the plant metabolic behavior. Eventually, a comprehensive pathway analysis was used to provide a pathway enrichment analysis and explore topological pathway characteristics dealing with the remarkable metabolites to demonstrate that galactose metabolism is the most significant pathway in the biological system of thyme.

"Sweating", a processing method of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), results in great changes in pharmacology and pharmacodynamics. Previously, chromatogram of 10 characteristic metabolites in S. miltiorrhiza showed a significant difference after "Sweating". Due to the complexity of TCM, changes in metabolites should be investigated metabolome-wide after "Sweating". An untargeted UPLC/MS-based metabolomics was performed to discover metabolites profile variation of S. miltiorrhiza after "Sweating". Multivariate analysis was conducted to screen differential metabolites. Analysis indicated distinct differences between sweated and non-sweated samples. 10,108 substance peaks had been detected altogether, and 4759 metabolites had been identified from negative and positive ion model. 287 differential metabolites were screened including 112 up-regulated and 175 down-regulated and they belong to lipids and lipid-like molecules, and phenylpropanoid and polyketides. KEGG analysis showed the pathway of linoleic acid metabolism, and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism were mainly enriched. 31 and 49 identified metabolites were exclusively detected in SSM and NSSM, respectively, which mainly belong to carboxylic acids and derivatives, polyketides and fatty acyls. By mapping tanshinones and salvianolic acids to 4759 identified metabolites library, 23 characteristic metabolites had been identified, among which 11 metabolites changed most. We conclude that "Sweating'' has significant effect on metabolites content and composition of S. miltiorrhiza.

AND EVALUATION OF ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY	BANGLADESH JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article							2,3-BUTANEDIOL; POLYSACCHARIDE	Analysis of the volatile metabolites and the antioxygenation ability of Lycium ruthenicum Murr. were investigated. Dynamic headspace collection and automated thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (ATD-GC-MS) were used to analyze the volatile metabolites of L. ruthenicumh. Twenty five metabolites were identified and derived from methanol extraction. These metabolites exhibited good antioxidant effect which was determined by DPPH, ABTS, and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). The main metabolites of L. ruthenicum were revealed by GC-MS to be alcohols, hydrocarbons, terpenoids, aromatic and ester compounds. Among 25 identified metabolites, trans-2,3-butanediol and methylene chloride were the most abundant. This test established a rapid assay method for the analysis of volatile components of L. ruthenicum. The results laid a foundation for further research and application of these compounds in antioxidant drugs and health products.

Selected Australian native fruits such as Davidson's plum, finger lime and native pepperberry have been reported to demonstrate potent antioxidant activity. However, comprehensive metabolite profiling of these fruits is limited, therefore the compounds responsible are unknown, and further, the compounds of nutritional value in these native fruits are yet to be described. In this study, untargeted and targeted metabolomics were conducted using the three fruits, together with assays to determine their antioxidant activities. The results demonstrate that targeted free and hydrolysed protein amino acids exhibited high amounts of essential amino acids. Similarly, important minerals like potassium were detected in the fruit samples. In antioxidant activity, Davidson's plum reported the highest activity in ferric reducing power (FRAP), finger lime in antioxidant capacity (ABTS), and native pepperberry in free radical scavenging (DPPH) and phosphomolybdenum assay. The compounds responsible for the antioxidant activity were tentatively identified using untargeted GCxGC-TOFMS and UHPLC-QqQ-TOF-MS/MS metabolomics. A clear discrimination into three clusters of fruits was observed using principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) analysis. The correlation study identified a number of compounds that provide the antioxidant activities. GCxGC-TOFMS detected potent aroma compounds of limonene, furfural, and 1-R-alpha-pinene. Based on the untargeted and targeted metabolomics, and antioxidant assays, the nutritional potential of these Australian bush fruits is considerable and supports these indigenous fruits in the nutraceutical industry as well as functional ingredients for the food industry, with such outcomes benefiting Indigenous Australian communities.

Despite all the efforts made, no serumspecific biomarker is currently used in the clinical management of patients with this tumor. In this study, comprehensive highresolution proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 NMR) and silver-109 nanoparticle-enhanced steel target laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry ((AgNPET)-Ag-109 LDI MS) approaches were conducted, in conjunction with multivariate data analysis, to discriminate the global serum metabolic profiles of kidney cancer (n = 50) and healthy volunteers (n = 49) . Eight potential biomarkers have been identified using H-1 NMR metabolomics and nine mass spectral features which differed significantly (p < 0.05) between kidney cancer patients and healthy volunteers, as observed by LDI MS. A partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) model generated from metabolic profiles obtained by both analytical approaches could robustly discriminate normal from cancerous samples (Q(2) > 0.7), area under the receiver operative characteristic curve (ROC) AUC > 0.96. Compared with healthy human serum, kidney cancer serum had higher levels of glucose and lower levels of choline, glycerol, glycine, lactate, leucine, myo-inositol, and 1-methylhistidine. Analysis of differences between these metabolite levels in patients with different types and grades of kidney cancer was undertaken. Our results, derived from the combination of LDI MS and H-1 NMR methods, suggest that serum biomarkers identified herein appeared to have great potential for use in clinical prognosis and/or diagnosis of kidney cancer.

Discrimination of common Iris species from Egypt based on their genetic and metabolic profiling	PHYTOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS			English	Article						DNA extraction; GC-MS; genetic fingerprint; genetic profiling; Iris; ISSR markersmetabolic fingerprint	DNA ISOLATION; IRIDACEAE; DIVERSITY; ISSR; POPULATIONS; LEAVES; RAPD; L.; ISOFLAVONOIDS; POLYMORPHISM	Introduction Irises have been medicinally used in Ancient Egyptians, Anatolian, Chinese, British and Irish folk medicine. They are also well-known ornamental plants that have economic value in the perfume industry. The main obvious diagnostic difference between the different species is based on the morphology of the flowers. The flowering cycle is very short as well as the persistence of the fully opened flowers extends for a few days only. Moreover, the climatic conditions significantly causes fluctuation in their blooming time from year to year. This makes the morphological discrimination very difficult. The discrimination of different iris species is of a great importance, as each species is reported to possess different folk medicinal activities. Objectives Finding genetic and metabolic markers for differentiation between Iris confusa Sealy (Subgen. Limniris Sect. Lophiris), I. pseudacorus L. (Subgen. Limniris Sect. Limniris) and I. germanica L. (Subgen. Iris Sect. Iris) on levels other than traditional taxonomic features. Material and Methods Inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses were performed. Results The highest similarity was found between I. pseudacorus L. and I. germanica L. and the least similarity was between I. confusa Sealy and I. pseudacorus L. The metabolic profiling of the leaves confirmed genetic profiling discriminating I. confusa from the other two species. The primary metabolites of the underground parts showed clear discrimination between the three species. Conclusions This study represents the sole complete map for distinguishing the three Iris species on genetic and metabolic bases.

Recent evidences have demonstrated that the consumption of dairy products may protect from MetS, but the mechanisms remains unknown. The present study aimed at identify how the consumption of different types of dairy products could modify the changes in plasma metabolome during MetS. Methods: In this observational study, we analyzed how the consumption of dairy products could modify the perturbations in the plasma metabolome induced by MetS in a sample of 298 participants (61 with MetS) from the French MONA LISA survey. Metabolomic profiling was analyzed with UPLC-MS/MS. Results: Subjects with MetS exhibited major changes in plasma metabolome. Significant differences in plasma levels of branched chain amino acids, gamma-glutamyl amino acids, and metabolites from arginine and proline metabolism were observed between healthy control and Mets subjects. Plasma levels of many lipid species were increased with MetS (mono- and diacylglycerols, eicosanoids, lysophospholipids and lysoplasmalogens), with corresponding decreases in short chain fatty acids and plasmalogens. The consumption of dairy products, notably with a low fat content (milk and fresh dairy products), altered metabolite profiles in plasma from MetS subjects. Specifically, increasing consumption of dairy products promoted accumulation of plasma C15:0 fatty acid and was inversely associated to some circulating lysophospholipids, sphingolipids, gamma-glutamyl amino acids, leukotriene B4 and lysoplasmalogens. Conclusions: the consumption of low fat dairy products could mitigate some of the variations induced by MetS. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

Esophageal squamous dysplasia (ESD) is considered as an immediate precancerous lesion of ESCC. Lack of biomarkers for discriminating ESCC and ESD from healthy subjects limits the early diagnosis and treatment of ESCC. Therefore, a serum metabolomic strategy was conducted to identify and validate potential metabolic markers for the screening of ESCC and ESD subjects. Methods: A total of 74 patients with ESCC, 72 patients with ESD, and 75 normal control (NC) subjects were enrolled in this study. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to acquire serum metabolic profiles. Pathway analysis was conducted to uncover the fluctuated metabolic pathways during ESCC. Multivariate analyses were used to screen and validate the biomarkers. Results: ESCC, ESD, and NC subjects revealed progressively altered metabolic profiles, in which amino acids globally increased, while fatty acids decreased in ESCCs compared with the control groups. Pathway analysis demonstrated the activated biosynthesis of amino acids and inhibited desaturation of saturated fatty acids. The panel constructed with propanoic acid, linoleic acid, glycerol-3-phosphate, and L-glutamine showed the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of 0.817, 0.75, and 0.74, respectively, in the discrimination of ESCC/ESD patients from NC subjects. The panel constructed by propanoic acid, L-leucine, and hydroxyproline revealed the AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.819, 0.76, and 0.72, respectively, in the discrimination of ESD from NC subjects. The combination of hypoxanthine, 2-ketoisocaproic acid, L-glutamate, and L-aspartate showed the AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.818, 0.83, and 0.74, respectively, in the discrimination of ESCC patients from ESD subjects. Conclusions: Our study revealed the systematic landscape for metabolic alterations in sera of ESD and ESCC patients. The defined metabolite markers showed reasonable performance in the discrimination of ESCC and ESD patients, and may provide helpful reference for clinicians and biologists.

The aim of this work was to perform profiling of metabolites and identification of features discriminating this pathology from the normal cornea. The combination of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS) techniques has been applied for profiling and identification of metabolites in corneal buttons from 6 healthy controls and 7 KC patients. An untargeted GC/MS-based approach allowed the detection of 377 compounds, including 46 identified unique metabolites, whose levels enabled the separation of compared groups of samples in unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis. There were 13 identified metabolites whose levels differentiated between groups of samples. Downregulation of several carboxylic acids, fatty acids, and steroids was observed in KC when compared to the normal cornea.

Physiological stress associated with mechanical harvesting and transport of cultured mussels (Perna canaliculus): A metabolomics approach	AQUACULTURE			English	Article						Greenshell mussels; Live transport; Survival; Physiological stress; Metabolic profiles	NEW-ZEALAND; HALIOTIS-DIVERSICOLOR; RESPONSES; SURVIVAL	Harvest and transport of farmed mussels are known to impose stress on the crop species. However, not much is known about molecular pathways underlying these physiological stresses. The present study investigated the effects of harvesting on the metabolome of the haemolymph and hepatopancreas of green-lipped mussels (Perna canaliculus), complemented by assessments of behaviour and survival under simulated dry and re-immersion live shipment scenarios. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomics approach was used to compare the metabolite profiles of control mussels (sampled directly from growing lines) with mechanically harvested mussels and post-transport mussels (after 3 h transport in water). The results showed differences in a large number of metabolites in both haemolymph and hepatopancreas of post-harvest and post transport mussels when compared to the control state. These metabolites are generally involved in energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, protein degradation and fatty acid metabolism. Mechanical harvesting induced metabolite changes typically associated with increased energy demand and a rapid transition to anaerobic glycolysis. Some metabolites began to return to baseline levels following a subsequent 3 h immersion during transportation. Re-immersion was also effective in prolonging life in mussels emersed in 9 degrees C air for three days. However, after six days emersion the mussels were moribund, dying after a total of 7.8 +/- 1.0 days in air or in the re-immersion tank. The findings highlight the importance of acute metabolic trauma in determining post-harvest outcomes and the potential role for transient recovery systems.

Piper anisum as a promising new source of bioactive metabolites	CHEMICAL PAPERS			English	Article						Antioxidant capacity; Antimicrobial compounds; Antitumor activity; Bioactive metabolites; Ethnopharmacology; Metabolomics	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; CROP RICINUS-COMMUNIS; MEDICINAL-PLANTS; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; ESSENTIAL OILS; FATTY-ACIDS; CYTOTOXIC ACTIVITIES; ANTITUMOR-ACTIVITY; ANTIOXIDANT; ALKALOIDS	Piper species are commonly used by indigenous communities to treat several gastrointestinal diseases. In China, they are also used as an active ingredient in formulae to treat cancer. The objective of the study was to perform a large-scale metabolite profiling analysis to identify bioactive compounds in Piper anisum. Antioxidant capacity was assessed by the DPPH assay and total phenolics were assessed by Folin-Ciocalteu's method. Antimicrobial activity was assessed against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, whereas cytotoxicity was assessed against tumor cell lines MCF-7, HCT116, HepG2 and HL-60, and non-tumor cell line MRC-5. The multiplatform metabolite profiling approach encompassed NMR, GC-MS and LC-MS analyses. P. anisum root extract showed the greatest antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content, followed by the stem and leaf extracts. P. anisum extracts showed a highly selective antimicrobial profile, being specifically active against C. albicans (MIC of 500 mu g mL(-1)). Additionally, the root extract (50 mu g mL(-1)) showed the highest cell inhibition percentages against tumor cell lines MCF-7 (59.5%), HCT116 (49.2%), and HepG2 (61.0%). Forty-eight metabolites were annotated by GC-MS and 27 by LC-MS. These included alkaloids, carbohydrates, fatty acids, hydrocarbons, organic acids, phenolic compounds, and terpenes. Taken together, these results showed that P. anisum root extract is a promising source of bioactive compounds.	[Batista, Danilo; Araujo, Floricea M.; Martins, Dirceu; Canuto, Gisele A.

ANTIOXIDANTS & REDOX SIGNALING			English	Article						schizophrenia; oxidative stress; metabolomics; Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry; inflammation		Schizophrenia is a chronic, disabling, and complex mental illness, of which the pathogenesis remains elusive. To provide clues for the pathogenesis and etiology of schizophrenia, we performed serum metabolic profiling in 54 patients with schizophrenia and 54 matched healthy controls using Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry. Based on 94 differential metabolites identified, we discovered two dysregulated metabolic pathways in schizophrenia, including the upregulated arachidonic acid-related pathway and the downregulated aromatic amino acid-related pathway. Moreover, carnitine was identified as a promising diagnostic biomarker for schizophrenia with an area under the curve of 0.997. Given the antioxidant and pro-oxidant properties of these altered metabolites, these results pointed to an imbalance of the redox homeostasis in schizophrenia, which was further confirmed by a remarkable elevation of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a reactive oxidative stress marker. Furthermore, correlation analyses demonstrated that 8-OHdG was negatively correlated with antioxidant biliverdin and positively related to oxidation products, 9-hydroxylinoleic acid and o-tyrosine, and that total antioxidant capacity was positively associated with antioxidant acetylcarnitine in schizophrenia. Our results lead to the hypothesis that the disturbed metabolic characteristics reveal enhanced oxidative stress, which in turn results in the damage of lipids, proteins, and DNA and ultimately promotes the development of schizophrenia.

The objective was to determine how iron deficiency in neonatal pigs alters the serum metabolomic profile using quantitative and qualitative analysis by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer (UPLCMS/MS). The current results revealed that iron deficiency led to a series of metabolic changes involved in tyrosine metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, bile secretion, primary bile acid biosynthesis, steroid biosynthesis, and upregulated activities of the urea cycle enzymes in the liver of neonatal piglets. Few studies focused on the effects of iron on characterizing alterations of metabolic processes in neonatal piglets. In the present study, 16 neonatal piglets were randomly assigned to two groups. In the first group piglets were given an intramuscularly injection of iron dextran at 150 mg as a positive control (CON) and the second group were not supplemented with iron as a negative control for iron deficiency (ID). At day 8, iron status, serum biochemical parameters, serum metabolome, hepatic histology, and hepatic expression of genes for the metabolism were analyzed. Results indicated that piglets without iron supplementation had significantly reduced iron values and increased blood urea nitrogen concentrations at day 8 (p< 0.05). Analysis of serum metabolome revealed that concentrations of serum lysine, leucine, tyrosine, methionine, and cholesterol were significantly decreased while concentrations of 3-Methyldioxyindole, chenodeoxycholate acid, indoleacetic acid, icosadienoic acid, phenylpyruvic acid, pantothenic acid, ursocholic acid, and cholic acid were significantly increased in iron deficient piglets (p< 0.05). Furthermore, expressions of cyp7a1 and the urea cycle enzyme (ornithinetranscarbamoylase and argininosuccinate synthetase) were significantly increased in iron deficient pigs (p< 0.05). The present experimental results indicated that neonatal piglets without iron supplementation drop to borderline anemia within 8 days after birth. Iron deficiency led to a series of metabolic changes involved in tyrosine metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, bile secretion, primary bile acid biosynthesis, steroid biosynthesis, and upregulated activities of the urea cycle enzymes in the liver of neonatal piglets, suggesting early effects on metabolic health of neonatal piglets.

Nevertheless, considering the invasive nature of liver analyses there are obvious ethical boundaries, particularly in babies and children. In this work, we investigated the suitability of blood plasma as an alternative matrix to evaluate the biological age of liver. With this aim, we studied the correlation of plasma and liver metabolomic profiles obtained by HPLC-TOF-MS for piglets of different ages (newborns, neonates and infants). By means of Pearson correlation analysis we observed that 360 and 1784 pairs of metabolite features were significantly correlated in positive and negative ionization mode, respectively. Procrustes analysis was applied in order to assess the similarity of the clustering resulting from the data obtained from the two matrices and the two ionisation modes. The Procrustes distances were low for both ESI+ (0.3753) and ESI- (0.3673) and, hence, liver and plasma are expected to provide similar discriminatory information. Furthermore, we found that Multiblock Principal Component Analysis (MB-PCA) readily allowed us to combine the data obtained from both matrices and to better understand the clustering according to the three study groups. Considering all these results, we suggest that plasma can provide valuable insight into the maturation grade of liver in order to provide accurate dosing in paediatric population.

Metabolome-Informed Microbiome Analysis Refines Metadata Classifications and Reveals Unexpected Medication Transfer in Captive Cheetahs	MSYSTEMS			English	Article						metabolome; metagenome; microbiome; cheetah; medication; antibiotics; metadata; Acinonyx jubatus	ANTIBIOTICS; IMPACTS	Even high-quality collection and reporting of study metadata in microbiome studies can lead to various forms of inadvertently missing or mischaracterized information that can alter the interpretation or outcome of the studies, especially with nonmodel organisms. Metabolomic profiling of fecal microbiome samples can provide empirical insight into unanticipated confounding factors that are not possible to obtain even from detailed care records. We illustrate this point using data from cheetahs from the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. The metabolomic characterization indicated that one cheetah had to be moved from the non-antibiotic-exposed group to the antibiotic-exposed group. The detection of the antibiotic in this second cheetah was likely due to grooming interactions with the cheetah that was administered antibiotics. Similarly, because transit time for stool is variable, fecal samples within the first few days of antibiotic prescription do not all contain detected antibiotics, and the microbiome is not yet affected. These insights significantly altered the way the samples were grouped for analysis (antibiotic versus no antibiotic) and the subsequent understanding of the effect of the antibiotics on the cheetah microbiome. Metabolomics also revealed information about numerous other medications and provided unexpected dietary insights that in turn improved our understanding of the molecular patterns on the impact on the community microbial structure. These results suggest that untargeted metabolomic data provide empirical evidence to correct records and aid in the monitoring of the health of nonmodel organisms in captivity, although we also expect that these methods may be appropriate for other social animals, such as cats. IMPORTANCE Metabolome-informed analyses can enhance omics studies by enabling the correct partitioning of samples by identifying hidden confounders inadvertently misrepresented or omitted from carefully curated metadata. We demonstrate here the utility of metabolomics in a study characterizing the microbiome associated with liver disease in cheetahs. Metabolome-informed reinterpretation of metagenome and metabolome profiles factored in an unexpected transfer of antibiotics, preventing misinterpretation of the data. Our work suggests that untargeted metabolomics can be used to verify, augment, and correct sample metadata to support improved grouping of sample data for microbiome analyses, here for nonmodel organisms in captivity. However, the techniques also suggest a path forward for correcting clinical information in microbiome studies more broadly to enable higher-precision analyses.

Methods We performed a cross-sectional study involving 113 subjects: 85 patients diagnosed with dry eye syndrome (dry eye group) and 28 healthy volunteers (control group). Reflex tears (20-30 mu l) were collected from the tear meniscus of both eyes of each subject using a Schirmer I test strip. MS data were acquired with a standard workflow by UPLC-Q/TOF-MS/MS. Metabolites were quantitatively analyzed and matched with entries in the Metlin, Massbank, and HMDB databases. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was conducted to detect important metabolites. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify the significant metabolic biomarker candidates for dry eye syndrome. Open database sources, including the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and MetaboAnalyst, were used to identify metabolic pathways. Results After the LASSO regression and multiple logistic regression analysis, 4 of 20 metabolic biomarker candidates were significantly correlated with Ocular Surface Disease Index score, 42 of 57 with fluorescein breakup time, and 26 of 57 with fluorescein staining. By focusing on the overlap of these three sets, 48 of 51 metabolites contributed to the incidence of dry eye and there were obvious changes in different age groups. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed that the main pathways were glucose metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and glutathione metabolism. Conclusion Dry eye syndrome induces changes in the metabolic profile of tears, and the trend differs with age. This evidence reveals the relationship between changes in metabolites, symptoms of dry eye syndrome, and age.

We investigate whether the hair metabolome profiles of neonates were associated with the pathophysiological differences across the different clinical forms of sIUGR in twins. Methods Hair samples were collected at delivery from 10 pairs of type 1 sIUGR twins, 8 pairs of types 2&3 sIUGR twins, and 11 pairs of twins without sIUGR. The hair metabolome was characterized using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results Our results demonstrated that the hair metabolite profiles of the different sIUGR subclinical forms were associated with the averaged fetal growth rate after 28 weeks of gestation but not with birthweight. The hair profiles were capable of discriminating type2&3 sIUGR twins from twins without sIUGR. In particular, the metabolites 2-aminobutyric acid, cysteine, alanine, and tyrosine all displayed areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were above 0.9. The metabolic pathway analysis highlighted the associations of sIUGR twins with abnormal umbilical artery flow with increased metabolites from a nutrient depletion pathway, glutathione metabolism, and nerve development. Conclusion This study offers novel insight into the severity of intrauterine ischemia and hypoxia for T2&3 sIUGR twins, through evaluation of the neonatal hair metabolome.

We focused on clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC) which is characterized by its clear and glycogen-enriched cytoplasm with unknown reasons. The aim of this study was to identify the clinical significance, biological function, and molecular regulation of glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1) in ccRCC glycogen accumulation and tumor progression. Methods: We determined the clinical relevance of GYS1 and glycogen in ccRCC by immunohistochemistry and periodic acid-schiff staining in fresh tissue and by tissue micro-array. Metabolic profiling with GYS1 depletion was performed by metabolomics analysis. In vitro and xenograft mouse models were used to evaluate the impact of GYS1 on cell proliferation. High-throughput RNA-Seq analyses and co-immunoprecipitation-linked mass spectrometry were used to investigate the downstream targets of GYS1. Flow cytometry and CCK8 assays were performed to determine the effect of GYS1 and sunitinib on cell viability. Results: We observed that GYS1 was significantly overexpressed and glycogen was accumulated in ccRCC tissues. These effects were correlated with unfavorable patient survival. Silencing of GYS1 induced metabolomic perturbation manifested by a carbohydrate metabolism shift. Overexpression of GYS1 promoted tumor growth whereas its silencing suppressed it by activating the canonical NF-kappa B pathway. The indirect interaction between GYS1 and NF-kappa B was intermediated by RPS27A, which facilitated the phosphorylation and nuclear import of p65. Moreover, silencing of GYS1 increased the synthetic lethality of ccRCC cells to sunitinib treatment by concomitantly suppressing p65. Conclusions: Our study findings reveal an oncogenic role for GYS1 in cell proliferation and glycogen metabolism in ccRCC. Re-sensitization of ccRCC cells to sunitinib suggests that GYS1 is a useful indicator of unfavorable prognosis as well as a therapeutic target for patients with ccRCC.

Trophoblast cell lines are commonly utilized for oxidative stress research due to their distinct uniform cell population and easy-to-apply interventions. However, conflicting results are often reported when different oxidative stress cell models are used. In this study, the aim was to characterize the intracellular and extracellular metabolite profiles of different oxidative stress cell models commonly used in the research of pregnancy complications. HTR8/SVneo human trophoblast cell lines were treated with five different oxidative stress-inducing conditions: Hypoxia (1% oxygen); hypoxia and reoxygenation; cobalt chloride (CoCl2; 300 mu mol/l); sodium nitroprusside (SNP; 2.5 mmol/l); and the serum of women with preeclampsia (10% v/v). Intracellular metabolites were extracted from cells and extracellular metabolites were collected from spent media for metabolomic analysis via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results demonstrated that there were distinct differences in the intracellular and extracellular metabolome between the different cell models. Meanwhile, treatments with exogenous drugs, such as CoCl2 and SNP, resulted in more similar metabolite profiles. These disparities between the different oxidative stress cell models will have implications for the applications of these results, and highlight the need for the standardization of oxidative stress cell models in obstetric research.

J	Wang, L; Wang, MX				Wang, Li; Wang, Meixia			In vitro metabolism of olaparib in liver microsomes by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry	RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY			English	Article							SPECIES-DIFFERENCES; INHIBITION; RAT	Rationales Olaparib is a Poly (ADP-ribose) Polymerase (PARP) inhibitor which has been developed as an anti-cancer agent. The purpose of this study was to characterize the metabolites of olaparib from liver microsomes and to reveal the interspecies differences between animals and humans. Methods Olaparib (20 mu M) was incubated with different species of liver microsomes at 37 degrees C for 1 h in the presence of NADPH. The incubation samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-HRMS) operated in positive ion mode. The metabolites were characterized by accurate masses, MS2 spectra and retention times. Results A total of 12 metabolites were detected and the structures of the metabolites were characterized based on their accurate masses, fragment ions and retention times. Four metabolites, i.e., M1, M10, M11 and M12, were unambiguously identified by using reference standards. The metabolic pathways of olaparib included hydroxylation, bis-hydroxylation, hydrolysis, dealkylation, dehydrogenation, and alcohol oxidation. Conclusions Compared with animal species, no human-specific metabolite was found in HLM. Dog also had a closer metabolic profile to humans. This study will be helpful for a better understanding of the species difference in pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics.

In this study, we performed metabolic profiling of multiple myeloma and identified potential metabolites associated with clinical characteristics, therapeutic efficacy, and prognosis of the disease. Fifty-five patients with newlydiagnosed multiple myeloma and thirty-seven healthy controls from August 2016 to October 2017 were randomly collected. The serum metabolic profiling was investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique and underwent statistical analysis. Twenty-seven metabolites were found to be significantly different between healthy controls and multiple myeloma patients. Eleven metabolites were significantly elevated, while sixteen metabolites were decreased in the multiple myeloma population. Metabolic changes were also observed in patients with renal impairment and bone destruction. Levels of urea were significantly decreased after treatment while levels of hypotaurine showed significant increase in the good-effect group (P<0.05), but not in the no-good-effect group (P>0.05). In multivariate statistical analyses, high cysteine and high hypotaurine are independent risk factors for poor treatment outcome. After adjustment for critical clinical characteristics, patients with high levels of glycolic acid and xylitol were found to be less likely to experience disease progression. Multiple myeloma demonstrates different metabolic characteristics compared with the healthy population. Among multiple myeloma patients, renal impairment and bone destruction showed additional metabolic characteristics. Cysteine and hypotaurine have value in predicting the treatment outcome, while glycolic acid and xylitol may be important prognostic factors for multiple myeloma.

V. parahaemo-lyticus contains several virulence factors, including type III secretion systems (T3SSs) and thermostable direct hemolysin (TDH). In particular, T3SS1 is a potent cytotoxic inducer, and T3SS2 is essential for causing acute gastroenteritis. Although much is known about manipulation of host signaling transductions by the V. parahaemolyti-cus effector, little is known about the host metabolomic changes modulated by V. parahaemolyticus . To address this knowledge gap, we performed a metabolomic analysis of the epithelial cells during V. parahaemolyticus infection using capillary electrophoresis-time of flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOF/MS). Our results revealed significant metabolomic perturbations upon V. parahaemolyticus infection. Moreover, we identified that T3SS1's VopQ effector was responsible for inducing the significant metabolic changes in the infected cells. The VopQ effector dramatically altered the host cell's glycolytic, tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), and amino acid metabolisms. VopQ effector disrupted host cell redox homeostasis by depleting cellular glutathione and subsequently increasing the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. IMPORTANCE The metabolic response of host cells upon infection is pathogen specific, and infection-induced host metabolic reprogramming may have beneficial effects on the proliferation of pathogens. V. parahaemolyticus contains a range of virulence factors to manipulate host signaling pathways and metabolic processes. In this study, we identified that the T3SS1 VopQ effector rewrites host metabolism in conjunction with the inflammation and cell death processes. Understanding how VopQ reprograms host cell metabolism during the infection could help us to identify novel therapeutic strategies to enhance the survival of host cells during V. parahaemolyticus infection.

After moisture content (MC) equilibration, seeds of "WAS170" (short-lived) and "IR65483" (long-lived) were stored at 10.9% MC and 45 degrees C. Samples for metabolite analysis were taken after 0 and 20 days of storage. Among 288 metabolites, two flavonoids (kaempferide and quercetin-3-arabinoside), one amino acid (S-sulfocysteine) and one sugar (D-glucose) increased in "IR65483" seeds after storage but were not detected in "WAS170" seeds. Based on the genome sequence database, we identified clear allelic differences with non-synonymous mutations on the six flavonol synthase genes regulating the accumulation of kaempferol- and quercetin-metabolites. On the other hand, two metabolites (thiamine monophosphate and harmaline) increased in short-lived seeds after storage; these metabolites could be potential biochemical indicators of seed deterioration.

Maternal metabolic profiling to assess fetal gestational age and predict preterm delivery: a two-centre retrospective cohort study in the US	BMJ OPEN			English	Article						health informatics; risk management; obstetrics	BIRTH; ULTRASOUND; SERUM; OUTCOMES	Objectives The aim of this study was to develop a single blood test that could determine gestational age and estimate the risk of preterm birth by measuring serum metabolites. We hypothesised that serial metabolic modelling of serum analytes throughout pregnancy could be used to describe fetal gestational age and project preterm birth with a high degree of precision. Study design A retrospective cohort study. Setting Two medical centres from the USA. Participants Thirty-six patients (20 full-term, 16 preterm) enrolled at Stanford University were used to develop gestational age and preterm birth risk algorithms, 22 patients (9 full-term, 13 preterm) enrolled at the University of Alabama were used to validate the algorithms. Outcome measures Maternal blood was collected serially throughout pregnancy. Metabolic datasets were generated using mass spectrometry. Results A model to determine gestational age was developed (R-2=0.98) and validated (R-2=0.81). 66.7% of the estimates fell within +/- 1 week of ultrasound results during model validation. Significant disruptions from full-term pregnancy metabolic patterns were observed in preterm pregnancies (R-2=-0.68). A separate algorithm to predict preterm birth was developed using a set of 10 metabolic pathways that resulted in an area under the curve of 0.96 and 0.92, a sensitivity of 0.88 and 0.86, and a specificity of 0.96 and 0.92 during development and validation testing, respectively. Conclusions In this study, metabolic profiling was used to develop and test a model for determining gestational age during full-term pregnancy progression, and to determine risk of preterm birth. With additional patient validation studies, these algorithms may be used to identify at-risk pregnancies prompting alterations in clinical care, and to gain biological insights into the pathophysiology of preterm birth. Metabolic pathway-based pregnancy modelling is a novel modality for investigation and clinical application development.

Current microorganisms' detection methods rely on techniques (plate counting), which provide retrospective values for microbial contamination. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the ability of the headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) methodologies to detect volatile organic carbons (VOCs), which may be associated to a peculiar microbiological contamination of food. The disposal of fast headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC/MS) able to accurately and rapidly (30 min per sample) detect pathogens in raw meat could replace the traditional and time-consuming (3 to 4 days) standardized microbiological analysis required by regulations. Experiments focused on qualitative and quantitative evaluations of VOCs produced bySalmonellaTyphimurium,Campylobacter jejuni, andStaphylococcus aureusin different types of raw meat (beef, pork, chicken). HS-SPME-GC/MS allowed to use smaller sample volumes compared to traditional methods with no sample processing and the potentiality for its application on various food matrices for the detection of a wide variety of pathogens. Data analysis showed the identification of unique VOCs' profiles being possible markers of meat contamination due to their association to specific pathogens. The identification of VOCs markers in association to selected bacterial pathogens and their metabolites could support the rapid determination of specific meat samples contamination. Further research is required to outline-specific metabolic profiles for each microorganism responsible of meat contamination and prevent false positives.

However, few studies have examined for health status related with metabolic disease of ketoacidosis following high-protein diet (HPD). Objectives Metabolomic analysis was performed for the monitoring of health status associated with metabolic disease of ketoacidosis in the plasma of Hanwoo heifers following a HPD. Methods Hanwoo heifers of 24 months with 459 +/- 42 kg weight were used under a 2 x 2 crossover design. The plasma was collected from control (n = 5) and HPD group (n = 5) on day 21 following diet adaptation for 20 days. Metabolic profiling analysis of organic acids (OAs), amino acids (AAs) and fatty acids (FAs) by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry combined with star pattern analysis was performed in plasma. Levels of OAs, AAs and FAs were evaluated by Mann-Whitney test, PCA and PLS-DA. Results In HPD group, ketoacidosis as metabolic disease was monitored by elevated acetoacetic acid and 3-hydroxybutyric acid. In addition, the elevation of ketogenic AAs, reduction of medium chain FAs and OAs with energy metabolism in TCA cycle were monitored in HPD group. Star graphic pattern was characteristic and readily distinguished between control and HPD groups. In PLS-DA, two groups were separated with VIP score of top-ranked 10 FAs as important metabolites for discrimination. Conclusion Elevation of ketone body including ketogenic AAs and reduced energy metabolism of FAs and OAs may useful for evaluation of health states associated with ketoacidosis from metabolic event by HPD in beef cattle.

L-Arginine supplementation in severe asthma	JCI INSIGHT			English	Article							DIPEPTIDYL PEPTIDASE 4; EXHALED NITRIC-OXIDE; L-CITRULLINE; METABOLISM; EXACERBATIONS; DYSFUNCTION; ARGINASE; SPUTUM; MODEL	BACKGROUND. Dysregulation of L-arginine metabolism has been proposed to occur in patients with severe asthma. The effects of L-arginine supplementation on L-arginine metabolite profiles in these patients are unknown. We hypothesized that individuals with severe asthma with low fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) would have fewer exacerbations with the addition of L-arginine to their standard asthma medications compared with placebo and would demonstrate the greatest changes in metabolite profiles. METHODS. Participants were enrolled in a single-center, crossover, double-blind L-arginine intervention trial at UCD. Subjects received placebo or L-arginine, dosed orally at 0.05 mg/kg (ideal body weight) twice daily. The primary end point was moderate asthma exacerbations. Longitudinal plasma metabolite levels were measured using mass spectrometry. A linear mixed-effect model with subject-specific intercepts was used for testing treatment effects. RESULTS. A cohort of 50 subjects was included in the final analysis. L-Arginine did not significantly decrease asthma exacerbations in the overall cohort. Higher citrulline levels and a lower arginine availability index (AAI) were associated with higher FeNO (P = 0.005 and P = 2.51 x 10(-9), respectively). Higher AAI was associated with lower exacerbation events. The eicosanoid prostaglandin H-2 (PGH(2)) and N-alpha-acetyl-L-arginine were found to be good predictors for differentiating clinical responders and nonresponders. CONCLUSIONS. There was no statistically significant decrease in asthma exacerbations in the overall cohort with L-arginine intervention. PGH(2), N-alpha-acetyl-L-arginine, and the AAI could serve as predictive biomarkers in future clinical trials that intervene in the arginine metabolome.

While surgery remains the optimal treatment strategy for individuals with early-stage LC, what the metabolic consequences are of such surgical intervention remains uncertain.MethodsNegative enrichment-fluorescence in situ hybridization (NE-FISH) was used in an effort to detect circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in pre- and post-surgery peripheral blood samples from 51 LC patients. In addition, targeted metabolomics analyses, multivariate statistical analyses, and pathway analyses were used to explore surgery-associated metabolic changes.ResultsLC patients had significantly higher CTC counts relative to healthy controls with 66.67% of LC patients having at least 1 detected CTC before surgery. CTC counts were associated with clinical outcomes following surgery. In a targeted metabolomics analysis, we detected 34 amino acids, 147 lipids, and 24 fatty acids. When comparing LC patients before and after surgery to control patients, metabolic shifts were detected via PLS-DA and pathway analysis. Further surgery-associated metabolic changes were identified when comparing LA (LC patients after surgery) and LB (LC patients before surgery) groups. We identified SM 42:4, Ser, Sar, Gln, and LPC 18:0 for inclusion in a biomarker panel for early-stage LC detection based upon an AUC of 0.965 (95% CI 0.900-1.000). This analysis revealed that SM 42:2, SM 35:1, PC (16:0/14:0), PC (14:0/16:1), Cer (d18:1/24:1), and SM 38:3 may offer diagnostic and prognostic benefits in LC.ConclusionsThese findings suggest that CTC detection and plasma metabolite profiling may be an effective means of diagnosing early-stage LC and identifying patients at risk for disease recurrence.

Metabolic Phenotyping Using UPLC-MS and Rapid Microbore UPLC-IM-MS: Determination of the Effect of Different Dietary Regimes on the Urinary Metabolome of the Rat	CHROMATOGRAPHIA			English	Article						Microbore columns; Ion mobility; Metabolite identification; Metabolic phenotyping	MOBILITY-MASS-SPECTROMETRY; HPLC-MS; PREDICTION	A rapid reversed-phase gradient method employing a 50 mm x 1 mm i.d., C18 microbore column, combined with ion mobility and high-resolution mass spectrometry, was applied to the metabolic phenotyping of urine samples obtained from rats receiving different diets. This method was directly compared to a "conventional" method employing a 150 x 2.1 mm i.d. column packed with the same C18 bonded phase using the same samples. Multivariate statistical analysis of the resulting data showed similar class discrimination for both microbore and conventional methods, despite the detection of fewer mass/retention time features by the former. Multivariate statistical analysis highlighted a number of ions that represented diet-specific markers in the samples. Several of these were then identified using the combination of mass, ion-mobility-derived collision cross section and retention time including N-acetylglutamate, urocanic acid, and xanthurenic acid. Kynurenic acid was tentatively identified based on mass and ion mobility data.

Desynchronized circadian rhythms may predispose individuals to disease or be indicative of underlying disease. Intensive care unit (ICU) patients likely experience desynchronized circadian rhythms due to disruptive environmental conditions in the ICU and underlying pathophysiology. This observational pilot study was undertaken to determine if 24-h rhythms are altered in ICU patients relative to healthy controls by profiling 24-h rhythms in vital signs and plasma metabolites. Methods:We monitored daily rhythms in 5 healthy controls and 5 ICU patients for 24 h. Heart rate and blood pressure were measured every 30 min, temperature was measured every hour, and blood was sampled for mass spectrometry-based plasma metabolomics every 4 h. Bedside sound levels were measured every minute. Twenty-four hours rhythms were evaluated in vitals and putatively identified plasma metabolites individually and in each group using the cosinor method. Results:ICU patient rooms were significantly louder than healthy controls' rooms and average noise levels were above EPA recommendations. Healthy controls generally had significant 24-h rhythms individually and as a group. While a few ICU patients had significant 24-h rhythms in isolated variables, no significant rhythms were identified in ICU patients as a group, except in cortisol. This indicates a lack of coherence in phases and amplitudes among ICU patients. Finally, principal component analysis of metabolic profiles showed surprising patterns in plasma sample clustering. Each ICU patient's samples were clearly discernable in individual clusters, separate from a single cluster of healthy controls. Conclusions:In this pilot study, ICU patients' 24-h rhythms show significant desynchronization compared to healthy controls. Clustering of plasma metabolic profiles suggests that metabolomics could be used to track individual patients' clinical courses longitudinally. Our results show global disordering of metabolism and the circadian system in ICU patients which should be characterized further in order to determine implications for patient care.

Emergence of advanced analytical instrumentations such as liquid chromatography hyphenated to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has allowed for unparallel elucidation of chemical compositions of various plants. Through such analyses, various chemical modifications such as glycosylation and other forms of isomerization have been shown to be an evolutionary strategy of plants to diversify their metabolite compositions (metabolome). Herein, metabolite fingerprinting of two closely related plant species visCoccinia grandisandCoccinia rehmanniirevealed that flavonoids attached to eitherdi-ortri-saccharides are prone to isomerization, a phenomenon termed glycoisomerization herein. Furthermore, modification known as sugar acylation by known biologically active metabolites such as derivatives of cinnamic acids (i. e., caffeic acid and coumaric acid) has been noted inC. rehmanniibut not inC. grandis. The findings of the current study reveal glycosylation patterns of flavonoids as an evolutionary strategy used by plants to diversify its metabolome, a phenomenon of which the biological consequence is still to be investigated.

Identifying metabolomic profiles of inflammatory diets in postmenopausal women	CLINICAL NUTRITION			English	Article						Dietary patterns; Inflammatory diets; Metabolomics; Postmenopausal women	POLYUNSATURATED FATTY-ACIDS; C-REACTIVE PROTEIN; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; BIOMARKERS; PATTERNS; RISK; RECEPTOR; COFFEE; REPRODUCIBILITY; ASSOCIATION	Background: We previously showed that a food-based empirical dietary inflammatory pattern (EDIP) score is associated with circulating inflammatory biomarkers. Metabolomic profiling of inflammatory diets may therefore provide insights on mechanisms contributing to disease etiology and prognosis. We aimed to elucidate metabolites associated with inflammatory diets among postmenopausal women, utilizing a robust study design that incorporates independent discovery and validation datasets. Methods: This baseline cross-sectional investigation evaluated associations between continuous EDIP scores calculated from food frequency questionnaires and 448 log-transformed plasma metabolites as outcomes in multivariable-adjusted linear regression analyses. Metabolites were measured with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy. Metabolite discovery was conducted among 1109 Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Hormone Therapy trial participants and results were replicated in an independent dataset of 810 WHI Observational Study participants. Secondary analyses were stratified by standard body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)) categories. In discovery and replication datasets statistical significance was based on false-discovery rate adjusted P < 0.05. Results: After adjusting for energy intake, BMI, physical activity, and other confounding variables, 23 metabolites were significantly associated with EDIP score in the discovery dataset. Of these, the following ten were replicated: trigonelline, caffeine, acethylamino-6-amino-3-methyluracil, 7-methylxanthine, 1,7-dimethyluric acid, 3-methylxanthine, C18:3CE, glycine, associated with lower dietary inflammatory potential; whereas C52:3 triacylglycerol and linoleate associated with higher dietary inflammatory potential. Four of the ten were associated [glycine (inversely), caffeine, 1,7-dimethyluric acid, C52:3 triacylglycerol, (positively)], with C-reactive protein levels. In secondary analyses, associations showed differences by BMI category. Four metabolites, related to coffee/caffeine metabolism were inversely associated among normal weight women, and 83 metabolites associated with EDIP among overweight/obese women, including 40 (48%) that were also associated with C-reactive protein. Conclusion: Metabolites associated with coffee/caffeine and lipid metabolism may reflect the inflammatory potential of diet. Potential differences by BMI and the linkage to disease outcomes, require further study. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism. All rights reserved.

Metabolic Systems Analysis of Shock-Induced Endotheliopathy (SHINE) in Trauma A New Research Paradigm	ANNALS OF SURGERY			English	Article						endotheliopathy; genome-scale metabolic model; metabolomics; systems biology; trauma		Objective: Investigate the endothelial cell phenotype (s) that causes Shock-Induced Endotheliopathy in trauma. Background: We have studied more than 2750 trauma patients and identified that patients with high circulating syndecan-1 (endothelial glycocalyx damage marker) in plasma have an increased mortality rate compared with patients with lower levels. Notably, we found that patients suffering from the same trauma severity could develop significantly different degrees of endothelial dysfunction as measured by syndecan-1. Methods: Prospective observational study of 20 trauma patients admitted to a Level 1 Trauma Centre and 20 healthy controls. Admission plasma syndecan-1 level and mass spectrometry were measured and analyzed by computational network analysis of our genome-scale metabolic model of the microvascular endothelial cell function. Results: Trauma patients had a significantly different endothelial metabolic profile compared with controls. Among the patients, 4 phenotypes were identified. Three phenotypes were independent of syndecan-1 levels. We developed genome-scale metabolic models representative of the observed phenotypes. Within these phenotypes, we observed differences in the cell fluxes from glucose and palmitate to produce Acetyl-CoA, and secretion of heparan sulfate proteoglycan (component of syndecan-1). Conclusions: We confirm that trauma patients have a significantly different metabolic profile compared with controls. A minimum of 4 shock-induced endotheliopathy phenotypes were identified, which were independent of syndecan-1level (except 1 phenotype) verifying that the endothelial response to trauma is heterogeneous and most likely driven by a genetic component. Moreover, we introduced a new research tool in trauma by using metabolic systems biology, laying the foundation for personalized medicine.

Previous studies into the classical pathways of marine microbial metabolism reveal diverse chemistries; however, metabolic profiling of marine microbes cultured with hydrocarbons is limited. In this study, taxonomic (amplicon sequencing) profiles of two environmental deep-sea sediments (>1,200 m deep) were obtained, along with taxonomic and metabolomic (mass spectrometry-based metabolomics) profiles of microbes harbored in deep-sea sediments cultured with hydrocarbons as the sole energy source. Samples were collected from the Gulf of Mexico (GM) and cultured for 28 days using simple (toluene, benzene, hexadecane, and naphthalene) and complex (petroleum API 40) hydrocarbon mixtures as the sole energy sources. The sediment samples harbored diverse microbial communities predominantly classified into Woeseiaceae and Kiloniellaceae families, whereas Pseudomonadaceae and Enterobacteriaceae families prevailed after sediments were cultured with hydrocarbons. Chemical profiling of microbial metabolomes revealed diverse chemical groups belonging primarily to the lipids and lipid-like molecules superclass, as well as the organoheterocyclic compound superclass (ClassyFire annotation). Metabolomic data and prediction of functional profiles indicated an increase in aromatic and alkane degradation in samples cultured with hydrocarbons. Previously unreported metabolites, identified as intermediates in the degradation of hydrocarbons, were annotated as hydroxylated polyunsaturated fatty acids and carboxylated benzene derivatives. In summary, this study used mass spectrometry-based metabolomics coupled to chemoinformatics to demonstrate how microbes from deep-sea sediments could be cultured in the presence of hydrocarbons. This study also highlights how this experimental approach can be used to increase the understanding of hydrocarbon degradation by deep-sea sediment microbes. IMPORTANCE High-throughput technologies and emerging informatics tools have significantly advanced knowledge of hydrocarbon metabolism by marine microbes. However, research into microbes inhabiting deep-sea sediments (>1,000 m) is limited compared to those found in shallow waters. In this study, a nontargeted and nonclassical approach was used to examine the diversity of bacterial taxa and the metabolic profiles of hydrocarbon-degrading deep-sea microbes. In conclusion, this study used metabolomics and chemoinformatics to demonstrate that microbes from deep-sea sediment origin thrive in the presence of toxic and difficult-to-metabolize hydrocarbons. Notably, this study provides evidence of previously unreported me- tabolites and the global chemical repertoire associated with the metabolism of hydrocarbons by deep-sea microbes.

In this study, the total phenolic contents, total flavonoid contents, and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging and inhibitory effects on alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase were determined for optimized hydroethanolic leaf extracts. Secondary metabolites were identified using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS).In vivostudies on diabetic albino mice were also carried out to evaluate the impact of the most active extract on their blood glucose levels. RESULTS The 60% ethanolic extract showed the highest extract yield (209.70 +/- 0.20 g kg(-1)) and total phenolic (154.24 +/- 3.28 mg gallic acid equivalent) and flavonoid (78.52 +/- 1.65 mg rutin equivalent per gram dried extract) contents and exhibited the maximum DPPH scavenging activity (IC50= 59.68 +/- 2.82 mu g mL(-1)). The IC(50)values for inhibition of alpha-glucosidase (58.42 +/- 2.22 mu g mL(-1)) and alpha-amylase (74.11 +/- 1.70 mu g mL(-1)) were also significant for the 60% ethanolic extract. The untargeted UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS-based metabolite profiling confirmed the presence of iridoid glucoside, gibberellin A4,O-beta-d-glucosyl-4-hydroxy-cinnamate, 3-methoxy-2-phyenyl-4H-furo[2,3-h]chromen-4-one, kaempferol, withaferin A, amentoflavone, quercitin-3-O-(6 ''-malonyl glucoside), ellagic acid, and gallic acid. Plant extract at a dose of 500 mg kg(-1)body weight reduced the blood glucose level by a considerable extent and also improved the lipid profile of diabetic mice after a 28-day trial. CONCLUSION The findings revealed the medicinal potential ofC. circinalisleaves to treat diabetes mellitus and provided the nutraceutical leads for functional food development.

Here, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) at 100 mg/kg were added to soils in the absence or presence of cucumber (Cucumis sativa) plants for 60 days. The response of the soil microbial community and associated soil metabolites was investigated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomics, respectively. The results show that AgNP exposure significantly increased the soil pH in both unplanted and cucumber-planted soils. The soil bacterial community structure was altered upon Ag exposure in both soils. Several functionally significant bacterial groups, which are associated with carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling, were compromised by AgNPs in both unplanted and cucumber-planted soils. Generally, plants played a limited role in mediating the impact of AgNPs on the bacterial community. Soil metabolomic analysis showed that AgNPs altered the metabolite profile in both unplanted and cucumber-planted soils. The significantly changed metabolites are involved in sugar and amino acid-related metabolic pathways, indicating the perturbation of C and N metabolism, which is consistent with the bacterial community structure results. In addition, several fatty acids were significantly decreased upon exposure to AgNPs in both unplanted and cucumber-planted soils, suggesting the possible oxidative stress imposed on microbial cell membranes. These results provide valuable information for understanding the biological and biochemical impact of AgNP exposure on both plant species and on soil microbial communities; such understanding is needed to understand the risk posed by these materials in the environment.

Our previous study has reported that GA has protective effect on realgar-induced hepatotoxicity. However, the details of the hepatoprotective mechanisms of GA on realgar-induced liver injury remain to be elucidated. In the study, mice were divided into control, GA-control, realgar, and co-treated groups. Their liver tissues were used for metabonomics study by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) method. The results illustrate that GA significantly ameliorate the liver injury and metabolic perturbations caused by realgar. Some metabolites, such as phenylalanine, pyroglutamic acid (PGA), proline, carnitine, nicotinamide, choline, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) 16 : 0 and LPC 18 : 2 were found responsible for the hepatoprotective effect of GA. These metabolites are associated with the methylation metabolism of arsenic, cell membrane structure, energy metabolism and oxidative stress. From the results of this study, we infer that the potential hepatoprotective mechanism of GA on realgar-induced liver injury may be associated with reducing arsenic accumulation and its methylation metabolism in the liver, promoting the conjugation of arsenic and GSH to play detoxification effect, and ameliorating the liver metabolic perturbations caused by realgar.

However, its potential toxicological effects remain poorly understood, especially at a low concentration found in the environment. In the present study, we investigated whether the consumption of low-concentration DCAN through drinking water would produce significant effects in male SD rats, with particular focus on their physiological traits and changes in their gut microbiome and metabolite profiles. After a 4-weeks DCAN intervention, significant changes were observed in the body weight, blood indices, and histology in DCAN-treated (100 mu g/L) group. Proteobacteria was relatively less abundant in 20 and 100 mu g/L DCAN-treated groups compared with that in the control group at phylum level. At genus level, Parasutterella and Anaerotruncus were significantly less abundant in both 20 and 100 mu g/L DCAN-treated groups than that in the control group. Furthermore, the gut microbiota-related metabolites were dramatically perturbed after DCAN consumption. In the 20 and 100 mu g/L DCAN-treated groups, there were 48 and 95 altered metabolites, respectively, and were found to be involved in sphingolipid signaling pathway, fatty acid biosynthesis, and cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. In summary, we demonstrated that consumption of low-concentration DCAN through drinking water could impair host health and induce gut microbiota dysbiosis and gut microflora-related metabolic disorders in male SD rats. Our findings highlight the potential toxicity of low-concentration DBPs and provide new insight into potential causal relationship between low concentration DBPs found in the drinking water and the host health.

As an emerging tool in precision medicine, metabolic analysis detects end products of pathways, and thus is more distal than proteomic/genetic analysis. However, metabolic analysis is far from ideal in clinical diagnosis due to the sample complexity and metabolite abundance in patient specimens. A further challenge is real-time and accurate tracking of treatment effect, e.g., radiotherapy. Here, Pd-Au synthetic alloys are reported for mass-spectrometry-based metabolic fingerprinting and analysis, toward medulloblastoma diagnosis and radiotherapy evaluation. A core-shell structure is designed using magnetic core particles to support Pd-Au alloys on the surface. Optimized synthetic alloys enhance the laser desorption/ionization efficacy and achieve direct detection of 100 nL of biofluids in seconds. Medulloblastoma patients are differentiated from healthy controls with average diagnostic sensitivity of 94.0%, specificity of 85.7%, and accuracy of 89.9%, by machine learning of metabolic fingerprinting. Furthermore, the radiotherapy process of patients is monitored and a preliminary panel of serum metabolite biomarkers is identified with gradual changes. This work will lead to the application-driven development of novel materials with tailored structural design and establishment of new protocols for precision medicine in near future.

Using untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, seven metabolites were found that were significantly correlated to high body condition, as well as to classic metabolic parameters indicating changes in lipid metabolism and inflammation. These seven metabolites include six distinct lysophosphatidylcholines and a phosphatidylethanolamine. By investigating the depth of metabolic changes in the plasma of over-conditioned fresh cows, this study may provide a metabolic basis for the diseases associated with over-conditioning. This study was undertaken to identify metabolite differences in plasma of dairy cows with a normal or high calving body condition score (CBCS), using untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics. Sixteen multiparous dairy cows were assigned to one of two groups based on CBCS (0 to 5 scale): Normal group (NBCS, 3.25 <= BCS <= 3.5,n= 8), and high BCS group (HBCS, BCS >= 4,n= 8). Plasma samples were collected for metabolomics analysis and evaluation of biomarkers of lipid metabolism (nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB)), and cytokines (leptin, adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 6 (IL-6)). A total of 23 differential metabolites were identified, and functional analyses were performed using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Among these metabolites, the concentrations of six lysophosphatidylcholines and one phosphatidylethanolamine, were lower in the HBCS group than in the NBCS group (p< 0.01). Furthermore, these metabolites were involved in these four pathways, among others: glycerophospholipid metabolism, retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, autophagy, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor biosynthesis (p< 0.05). In addition, plasma concentrations of leptin (p= 0.06) and TNF-alpha (p= 0.08) tended to be greater while adiponectin (p= 0.09) lower in HBCS cows than in NBCS cows. The concentrations of NEFA, BHB, or IL-6 did not differ between NBCS and HBCS groups. More importantly, based on the results of the Spearman's correlation analysis, the seven important metabolites were negatively correlated with indices of lipid metabolisms, proinflammatory cytokines, and leptin, but positively correlated with adiponectin. These results demonstrate that CBCS has a measurable impact on the plasma metabolic profile, even when NEFA and BHB are not different. In addition, the identified differential metabolites were significantly correlated to lipid metabolism and inflammation in the over-conditioned fresh cows, which are expected to render a metabolic basis for the diseases associated with over-conditioned dry cows.

Since machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used for exploring metabolomic profiles, we evaluated performance of some ML models for dissecting patients with CCA or benign biliary diseases according to their plasma BAs profiles. We used ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) for assessing plasma BAs profile in 112 patients (70 CCA, 42 benign biliary diseases). Twelve normalisation procedures were applied, and performance of six ML algorithms were evaluated (logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, naive bayes, RBF SVM, random forest, extreme gradient boosting). Naive bayes, using direct bilirubin concentration for normalisation of BAs, was the ML model displaying better performance in the holdout set, with an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.95, 0.79 sensitivity, 1.00 specificity. This model, also characterised by 1.00 positive predictive value and 0.73 negative predictive value, displayed a globally excellent accuracy (86.4%). The accuracy of the other five models was lower, and AUCs ranged 0.75-0.95. Preliminary results of this study show that application of ML to BAs profile analysis can provide a valuable contribution for characterising bile duct diseases and identifying patients with higher likelihood of having malignant pathologies.

Since crude extracts from mature leaves, stems, and fruits are the most common parts of this plant used for medicinal preparations, the same were selected for isolation of endophytes to assess the medicinal utility of their metabolite extracts as an extension to metabolite extracts from the different plant parts. Metabolites were extracted from the three plant parts using hexane, ethyl acetate, and dichloromethane (DCM) : methanol (MeOH) (1:1 v/v), while extracts from endophytes were extracted using hexane, ethyl acetate and DCM. Phytochemical and antimicrobial screening were performed using extracts from C. africana leaves, stems, and fruits. This was followed by identification of volatile compounds in plant and endophyte extracts using a two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with time of flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOF-MS). Four fungal endophytes from the Aspergillus genus and seven bacterial endophytes from the Kocuria, Bacillus, Arthrobacter, Staphylococcus, and Micrococcus genera were isolated from C. africana. Alkaloids, tannins, and reducing sugars tested positive in plant extracts while the presence of saponins and flavonoids was not observed. The hexane extract from the fruits was comparatively found to have the highest antibacterial activity with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 4 mg/ mL on Staphylococcus aureus. Profiling of metabolites on GCxGC-TOF-MS showed the presence of several bioactive compounds in plant and endophytic extracts. Thirteen compounds found in plant extracts were also detected in the cultures of fungal and bacterial endophytes. It was concluded that C. africana fruit hexane extracts have antibacterial activity and that the plant's endophytes can produce some of their host's compounds. Furthermore, combining plant and endophytic crude extracts may extend the medicinal utility of C. africana.

Differences and/or similarities between stem and root response to mechanical constraints remain almost unknown especially in relation to phytohormones distribution and RW characteristics. Thus, Populus nigra stem and root subjected to static non-destructive mid-term bending treatment were analyzed. The distribution of tension and compression forces was firstly modeled along the main bent stem and root axis; then, anatomical features, chemical composition, and a complete auxin and cytokinin metabolite profiles of the stretched convex and compressed concave side of three different bent stem and root sectors were analyzed. The results showed that in bent stems RW was produced on the upper stretched convex side whereas in bent roots it was produced on the lower compressed concave side. Anatomical features and chemical analysis showed that bent stem RW was characterized by a low number of vessel, poor lignification, and high carbohydrate, and thus gelatinous layer in fiber cell wall. Conversely, in bent root, RW was characterized by high vessel number and area, without any significant variation in carbohydrate and lignin content. An antagonistic interaction of auxins and different cytokinin forms/conjugates seems to regulate critical aspects of RW formation/development in stem and root to facilitate upward/downward organ bending. The observed differences between the response stem and root to bending highlight how hormonal signaling is highly organ-dependent.

Management includes the use of single resistance (Rz) genes. However, strains with the ability to overcome the widely used Rz1 resistance gene have already been reported. The mechanisms associated with these genes are unknown, therefore increased understanding of the host defense response may lead to more durable sources of rhizomania resistance. Non-targeted metabolome profiling, coupled with targeted phytohormone quantification, was applied to characterize the metabolic and signaling pathways associated with BNYVV infections in sugar beet. Clear differences in metabolites were identified following pathogen infection independent of plant genotype particularly those associated with host lipid composition or other membrane associated functions.

We developed a model of age based on untargeted metabolic profiling across multiple platforms, including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in urine and serum, within a large sample (N = 2,239) from the UK Airwave cohort. We validated a subset of model predictors in a Finnish cohort including repeat measurements from 2,144 individuals. We investigated the determinants of accelerated aging, including lifestyle and psychological risk factors for premature mortality. The metabolomic age model was well correlated with chronological age (mean r = .86 across independent test sets). Increased metabolomic age acceleration (mAA) was associated after false discovery rate (FDR) correction with overweight/obesity, diabetes, heavy alcohol use and depression. DNA methylation age acceleration measures were uncorrelated with mAA. Increased DNA methylation phenotypic age acceleration (N = 1,110) was associated after FDR correction with heavy alcohol use, hypertension and low income. In conclusion, metabolomics is a promising approach for the assessment of biological age and appears complementary to established epigenetic clocks.

We attempted to predict drug response of faropenem using a pharmacometabonomic approach. Metabolic profiling was performed on predose plasma samples from 36 healthy volunteers by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), with 204 endogenous metabolites detected. Plasma concentration was measured after drug administration, using high pressure liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (LC/MS/MS), and the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. Then a two-stage partial least squares strategy was employed to screen potential biomarkers and predict the pharmacokinetic parameters of faropenem. The results showed a good prediction of AUC and C-max with the screened biomarkers, and metabolites such as valine, proline, aspartic acid, gluconic acid, glucuronic acid, and 2-ketoisocaproic acid were indicated as candidate biomarkers. Finally, we explored the mechanism of individual variation by pathway enrichment analysis, and it suggested that organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1) and 3 (OAT3) might be responsible for individual variation of faropenem, and this hypothesis was verified by an experiment in rats.

This is an observational, longitudinal, prospective cohort study of a total of 51 serial urine samples from 15 healthy pregnant women, aged 29-40 years, which were collected before the onset of labor (out of labor, OL). In the same women, during labor (in labor or dilating phase, IL-DP). Samples were analyzed by hydrophilic interaction ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HILIC-UPLC-MS), a highly sensitive, accurate, and unbiased approach. Metabolites were then subjected to multivariate statistical analysis and grouped by metabolic pathway. This method was used to identify the potential biomarkers. The top 20 most discriminative metabolites contributing to the complete separation of OL and IL-DP were identified. Urinary metabolites displaying the largest differences between OL and IL-DP belonged to steroid hormone, particularly conjugated estrogens and amino acids much of this difference is determined by the fetal contribution. In addition, our results highlighted the efficacy of using urine samples instead of more invasive techniques to evaluate the difference in metabolic analysis between OL and IL-DP.

Targeted Urine Metabolomics for Monitoring Renal Allograft Injury and Immunosuppression in Pediatric Patients	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						kidney transplantation; metabolomics; immunosuppression; urine; acute rejection; immunosuppression; allograft	ACUTE REJECTION; TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS; KIDNEY; CLASSIFICATION; DISEASE; PROTEIN; MECHANISMS; PROTEOMICS; DIAGNOSIS; TRANSPORT	Despite new advancements in surgical tools and therapies, exposure to immunosuppressive drugs related to non-immune and immune injuries can cause slow deterioration and premature failure of organ transplants. Diagnosis of these injuries by non-invasive urine monitoring would be a significant clinical advancement for patient management, especially in pediatric cohorts. We investigated the metabolomic profiles of biopsy matched urine samples from 310 unique kidney transplant recipients using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Focused metabolite panels were identified that could detect biopsy confirmed acute rejection with 92.9% sensitivity and 96.3% specificity (11 metabolites) and could differentiate BK viral nephritis (BKVN) from acute rejection with 88.9% sensitivity and 94.8% specificity (4 metabolites). Overall, targeted metabolomic analyses of biopsy-matched urine samples enabled the generation of refined metabolite panels that non-invasively detect graft injury phenotypes with high confidence. These urine biomarkers can be rapidly assessed for non-invasive diagnosis of specific transplant injuries, opening the window for precision transplant medicine.

Methods Ethological study and ELISA assay were applied to measure the phenotypes of depression after CUMS stimulate and assess the antidepressant activity of fluoxetine, CSGS and its compatibilities. The serum metabolic profile changes were revealed by untargeted Q/TOF MS-based metabolomics followed by multivariate statistical analysis. Key findings CSGS exhibits an significant intervention effect on CUMS-induced depression. After the multivariate statistical analysis, 17 potential serum biomarkers were identified and 16 of them could be regulated by CSGS. The intervention of CSGS on CUMS-induced depression involved five key pathways. Moreover, each functional unit (monarch, minister, assistant and guide medicine) in CSGS regulates different metabolites and metabolic pathways to achieve different effects on antidepressant; however, their intervention efficacies are inferior to the holistic formula, which may be due to the synergism of bioactive ingredients in the seven herbs of CSGS. Conclusions CSGS produced an obvious antidepressant activity. The comprehensive and holistic metabolomics approach could be a powerful tool to study the intervention mechanism and the compatibility rule of traditional Chinese medicine.

Metabolomics investigation of summer mortality in New Zealand Greenshell (TM) mussels (Perna canaliculus)	FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						Mussel summer mortality; Metabolomics; Flow cytometry; Shellfish immunology; Perna canaliculus; Antimicrobial metabolites	CLAM RUDITAPES-PHILIPPINARUM; HALIOTIS-DIVERSICOLOR; ITACONIC ACID; RESPONSES; IMMUNITY; MARINE; INTEGRATION; METABOLISM; BIOMARKERS; INFECTION	Increasing water temperatures due to climate change have resulted in more frequent high mortality events of New Zealand Greenshell (TM) mussels (Perna canaliculus Gmelin 1791). These events have significant impacts within mussel farms which support a major shellfish industry for New Zealand. The present study investigates metabolic responses of farmed mussels during a summer mortality event in order to identify health impacts and elucidate mechanistic effects of external stressors on mussels. A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomics approach was used to identify metabolic perturbations and flow cytometry assays were used to assess viability, oxidative stress and apoptosis of haemocytes from healthy and unhealthy mussels during a summer mortality event. The results showed significantly higher mortality and apoptosis of haemocytes in unhealthy mussels compared to healthy mussels. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which is an indicator of oxidative stress was very high in both mussel groups, but no differences were observed between the two mussel groups. Metabolomics revealed alterations of many metabolites in both haemolymph and hepatopancreas (digestive gland) of unhealthy mussels compared to healthy mussels, reflecting perturbations in several molecular pathways, including energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, protein degradation/tissue damage and oxidative stress. An increased level of itaconic acid which is an antimicrobial metabolite and biomarker of pathogen infection was observed in haemolymph, but not in hepatopancreas samples. This investigation provides the first detailed metabolic characterization of mussel immune responses to a summer mortality event and illustrates the benefits of using an integrated metabolomics and flow cytometry workflow for mussel health assessment and biomarker identification for summer mortality early detection.

Here we report that multi-omics and integrative data analysis (multiple co-inertia analysis, MCIA) can be used to gain deeper insights into these relationships and identify microbiota and metabolite fingerprints that could be used to monitor product quality and authenticity. Our study into different brands of artisanal and industrial cheddar cheeses showed that Streptococcus, Lactococcus and Lactobacillus were the dominant taxa with overall microbial community structures differing not only between industrial and artisanal cheeses but also among different cheese brands. Metabolome analysis also revealed qualitative and semi-quantitative differences in metabolites between different cheeses. This also included the presence of two compounds (3-hydroxy propanoic acid and O-methoxycatechol-O-sulphate) in artisanal cheese that have not been previously reported in any type of cheese. Integrative analysis of multi-omics datasets revealed that highly similar cheeses, identical in age and appearance, could be distinctively clustered according to cheese type and brand. Furthermore, the analysis detected strong relationships, some previously unknown, which existed between the cheese microbiota and metabolome, and uncovered specific taxa and metabolites that contributed to these relationships. These results highlight the potential of this approach for identifying product specific microbe/metabolite signatures that could be used to monitor and control cheese quality and product authenticity.

Phenotypic screening is once again at the forefront of antibiotic discovery, yet Mechanism-Of-Action (MOA) identification is still a major bottleneck. As such, methods capable of MOA elucidation coupled with the high-throughput screening of whole cells are required now more than ever, for which Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a promising metabolic fingerprinting technique. A high-throughput whole-cell FTIR spectroscopy-based bioassay was developed to reveal the metabolic fingerprint induced by 15 antibiotics on the Escherichia coli metabolism. Cells were briefly exposed to four times the minimum inhibitory concentration and spectra were quickly acquired in the high-throughput mode. After preprocessing optimization, a partial least squares discriminant analysis and principal component analysis were conducted. The metabolic fingerprints obtained with FTIR spectroscopy were sufficiently specific to allow a clear distinction between different antibiotics, across three independent cultures, with either analysis algorithm. These fingerprints were coherent with the known MOA of all the antibiotics tested, which include examples that target the protein, DNA, RNA, and cell wall biosynthesis. Because FTIR spectroscopy acquires a holistic fingerprint of the effect of antibiotics on the cellular metabolism, it holds great potential to be used for high-throughput screening in antibiotic discovery and possibly towards a better understanding of the MOA of current antibiotics.

However, the effects of fluoride on serum metabolome have not been reported until now. In this study, the models of 3-week-old rats exposed fluoride by breast milk and 11-week-old rats exposed fluoride via breast milk and drinking water containing sodium fluoride (100 mg/L) were established. Using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), as compared with control group, 28 negative (NEG) and 52 positive (PUS) metabolites were significantly up-regulated, meanwhile 30 NEG and 21 POS significantly down-regulated metabolites were found in serum of 3-week-old rats exposed to fluoride. For 11-week-old fluorosis rats, there were 119 NEG and 65 POS metabolites significantly increased, and 7 NEG, 5 POS metabolites were obviously decreased. Importantly, nicotinamide, adenosine, 1-Oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (OGPC), and 1-Stearoyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphocholine (SGPC) were shared by two models. The metabolites of urea cycle, such as urea and N2-Acetyl-L-ornithine, betaine as a methyl donor, were regarded to reflect the fluorosis degree. These metabolites could be the potential markers of fluorosis, contributing to the prevention and treatment of fluorosis. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These compounds have an ecological role as feeding deterrents, with a wide variation in their composition depending on the location where the sample is collected. In Colombia, this soft coral can be found at different locations in the Caribbean Sea including Santa Marta, Islas del Rosario, and Providencia three environmentally different coral reef areas in the south and southwest Caribbean Sea. In order to evaluate differences in erythrolide composition, the metabolic profiles of samples from each of these locations were analyzed by HPLC-MS. Principal component analysis showed changes in the diterpene composition according to the sample origin. Diterpenes from samples collected at each location were isolated to describe the three chemotypes. The chemotype from Santa Marta was highly diverse, with the new erythrolides W and chi together with eight known erythrolides. The sample from Islas del Rosario showed a low diversity chemotype constituted by high amounts of erythrolide A and B.

In recent years, metabolomics has been emerged as key tool to understand molecular basis of disease, find diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, and develop new treatment opportunities. One of the most important challenge for metabolomics analysis is sample complexity due to wide concentration dynamics. In untargeted metabolomics studies for human plasma samples, generally there is no pre-fractioning method for metabolites prior to LC/MS analysis. This situation causes problem for analysis of some specific metabolites belonging to different pathways in such a complex system. In this study, it was offered liquid-liquid extraction and ultrafiltration-based sample preparation technique for fractioning of non-polar metabolites. Human plasma metabolites were extracted with a well-known cosolvent system (methanol/water/chloroform) and separated according to their polarity in aqueous and organic phases. Ultrafiltration process was performed for both phases to clean-up the sample. Solvents were evaporated and the remaining parts were dissolved in an organic solvent, acetonitrile, to obtain the non-polar metabolite mixtures. Samples were analyzed using Q-TOF LC/MS system for metabolite profiling. Metabolites were separated in a C18 (Agilent Zorbax C18 1.8 mu M, 50 x 2.1 mm) column at 0.200 ml min(-1) flow rate. Water and acetonitrile mixture including 0.1% formic acid was used as the mobile phase in a 25 min gradient elution system. In the aqueous phase, 249 peaks were found and 60 peaks were obtained in the organic phase. 14 peaks were common in both phases. Results showed that co- solvent system could be used for pre-fractioning of metabolites and reduce complexity of human plasma for metabolite profiling.

In this forward-looking review we provide an overview on the origins of metabolomics, on its role in this postgenomic era of biochemistry and its application to investigate metabolite role and (bio)activity, from model systems to human population studies. We present the challenges inherent to this analytical science, and approaches and modes of analysis that are used to resolve, characterize and measure the infinite chemical diversity contained in the metabolome (including lipidome) of complex biological matrices. In the current outbreak of metabolic diseases such as cardiometabolic disorders, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, metabolomics appears to be ideally situated for the investigation of disease pathophysiology from a metabolite perspective.

Jiaotaiwan is a traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of insomnia and depressive-like symptoms. In this study, the major chemical components in Jiaotaiwan were qualitatively analyzed using ultra high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and a model of depression in rats was subsequently established with chronic unpredictable mild stress followed by Jiaotaiwan intervention. Next, the metabolic profile of rat serum samples was analyzed using nontargeted metabolomics, wherein changes in the metabolites in serum samples before and after Jiaotaiwan administration were measured by multiple statistical approaches. Principal component analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis indicated that the Jiaotaiwan treatment improved the metabolic phenotype depression. Moreover, the heatmap analysis identified the most important ten biomarkers involved in depression. According to the pathway analysis, the therapeutic effect of Jiaotaiwan on depression may involve the regulation of amino acid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and energy metabolism. These findings help us understand the pathogenesis of depression in-depth, and discover targets for clinical diagnosis and treatment. And it also lays a foundation for the use of Jiaotaiwan as an antidepressant agent.

Due to thorny endogenous interferences, the metabolism pathways of naringin and exact amounts of derived phenolic catabolites have not been definitely assigned. In this work, stable isotope-labeling-based liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry methods were developed to eliminate the endogenous interferences. [2',3',5',6'-D-4]-naringin was orally administrated to rats. Urine and feces samples were collected and then analyzed with ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS). A total of 21 flavonoid metabolites and 11 phenolic catabolites were screened. The metabolism and catabolism pathways were proposed. Furthermore, deuterated naringin and its main metabolites were determined with rapid resolution liquid chromatography tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (RRLC-QqQ-MS/MS). The overall recovery of ingested deuterated naringin was calculated as 56.9% without endogenous interferences. The obtained results provide essential information for further pharmacological studies of naringin.

In Situ Mass Spectrometry Diagnostics of Impaired Glucose Tolerance Using Label-Free Metabolomic Signature	DIAGNOSTICS			English	Article						mass spectrometry; label-free; diagnostic signature; blood plasma; impaired glucose tolerance		In metabolomics, mass spectrometry is used to detect a large number of low-molecular substances in a single analysis. Such a capacity could have direct application in disease diagnostics. However, it is challenging because of the analysis complexity, and the search for a way to simplify it while maintaining the diagnostic capability is an urgent task. It has been proposed to use the metabolomic signature without complex data processing (mass peak detection, alignment, normalization, and identification of substances, as well as any complex statistical analysis) to make the analysis more simple and rapid. Methods: A label-free approach was implemented in the metabolomic signature, which makes the measurement of the actual or conditional concentrations unnecessary, uses only mass peak relations, and minimizes mass spectra processing. The approach was tested on the diagnosis of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Results: The label-free metabolic signature demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy for IGT equal to 88% (specificity 85%, sensitivity 90%, and area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.91), which is considered to be a good quality for diagnostics. Conclusions: It is possible to compile label-free signatures for diseases that allow for diagnosing the disease in situ, i.e., right at the mass spectrometer without complex data processing. This achievement makes all mass spectrometers potentially versatile diagnostic devices and accelerates the introduction of metabolomics into medicine.

Ethyl acetate extracts from the endophytes and the leaves (methanol: dichloromethane (1 : 1)) were used for antibacterial activity against selected pathogenic bacterial strains by using the broth microdilution method. The anticancer activity against the U87MG glioblastoma and A549 lung carcinoma cells was determined by the MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxy-phenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) assay. Bacterial endophytes that were successfully isolated from C. macowanii leaves include Raoultella ornithinolytica, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Pseudomonas sp., Pseudomonas palleroniana, Pseudomonas putida, Bacillus safensis, Enterobacter asburiae, Pseudomonas cichorii, and Arthrobacter pascens. Pseudomonas cichorii exhibited broad antibacterial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria while Arthrobacter pascens displayed the least MIC of 0.0625 mg/mL. Bacillus safensis crude extracts were the only sample that showed notable cell reduction of 50% against A549 lung carcinoma cells at a concentration of 100 mu g/mL. Metabolite profiling of Bacillus safensis, Pseudomonas cichorii, and Arthrobacter pascens crude extracts revealed the presence of known antibacterial and/or anticancer agents such as lycorine (1), angustine (2), crinamidine (3), vasicinol (4), and powelline. It can be concluded that the crude bacterial endophyte extracts obtained from C. macowanii leaves can biosynthesize bioactive compounds and can be bioprospected for medical application into antibacterial and anticancer agents.

Methods In this TAVR cohort with prospectively collected data, blood samples were obtained before TAVR valve deployment and at the 7th day after TAVR, which were then sent for liquid and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry detection. Besides comparisons between BAV and TAV, BAV patients were also divided in subgroups according to baseline hemodynamics (i.e. maximal transaortic velocity, V-max) and post-procedural reverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling (i.e. the change in LV mass index from baseline, increment LVMI) for further analysis. Metabolic differences between groups were identified by integrating univariate test, multivariate analysis and weighted correlation network analysis algorithm. Results A total of 57 patients were enrolled including 33 BAV patients. The BAV group showed lower arginine and proline metabolism both before and post TAVR than TAV represented by decreased expression of L-Glutamine. In BAV subgroup analysis, patients with baseline V-max > 5 m/s (n = 11) or the 4(th) quartile of change in increment LVMI at one-year follow-up (i.e. poorly-recovered LV, n = 8) showed elevated arachidonic acid metabolism compared with V-max < 4.5 m/s (n = 12) or the 1(st) quartile of increment LVMI (i.e. well-recovered LV, n = 8) respectively. Conclusions Difference in arginine and proline metabolism was identified between BAV and TAV in TAVR recipients. Elevated arachidonic acid metabolism may reflect more severe baseline hemodynamics and worse LV reserve remodeling after TAVR in BAV.

Different Fritillaria species have distinct pharmacological effects despite of their similar appearances. Effective differentiation of Fritillaria species can avoid adulteration and is crucial to its clinical uses. In this paper, a hybrid method of matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry and multivariate statistical analysis was developed for the rapid and reliable differentiation of Fritillaria species for the first time. Significantly different patterns for five Fritillaria species were obtained by MALDI-MS after instant sample extractions. Different groups of Fritillaria were confidently differentiated via an orthogonal partial least square model. In addition, a metabolomic taxonomy of five Fritillaria species was obtained based on MALDI-MS data. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To find biomarkers of calcium deficiency and further confirm these biomarkers in serum, we performed serum metabolomics analysis of calcium-deficient rats. Methods A calcium-deficient rat model was established with a low-calcium diet for 12 weeks. Serum metabolomics based UPLC/Q-TOF MS/MS and multivariate statistical analysis was performed to identify the alterations in metabolites associated with calcium deficiency in rats. Results Bone mineral density, serum parathyroid hormone and alkaline phosphatase were significantly decreased in the low-calcium diet group (LCG) compared to the normal calcium diet group (NCG). Serum metabolic-profiling analysis could definitively distinguish between the LCG and NCG and identified 24 calcium-deficient biomarkers. Three metabolites (indoxyl sulfate, phosphate, and taurine) of the 24 biomarkers were found in our previous urinary metabolomics study of rats with a calcium deficiency and nutritional rickets. The areas under the curve (AUCs) of these three biomarkers were greater than 0.8, and the combination of any two biomarkers was higher than 0.95. Conclusion Dietary calcium deficiency induced the alterations of metabolites in the serum of rats, and the three identified biomarkers had relatively high diagnostic values for calcium deficiency in rats.

Choline, a compound that has previously been shown to have potential use as a biomarker of egg age, was observed to have a significantly lower abundance in the yolks of eggs that were stored at 5 degrees C for five weeks compared to eggs stored at 23 degrees C for the same length of time. A follow-up targeted study observed that the previously discovered trend of increasing choline concentration in egg yolk, with increasing egg age, is not repeatable when the eggs are stored at 5 degrees C rather than 23 degrees C. It concluded that, by refrigerating eggs at 5 degrees C, the accurate prediction of egg age using choline as a biomarker can be prevented.

Residual feed intake divergence during the preweaning period is associated with unique hindgut microbiome and metabolome profiles in neonatal Holstein heifer calves	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Feed efficiency; Gut; Metabolomics; Microbiota; Neonates; Newborn; Preweaning; RFI	AMINO-ACIDS; NUTRIENT UTILIZATION; METHANE EMISSIONS; LARGE-INTESTINE; GUT MICROBIOTA; GROWING-PIGS; DAIRY-COWS; EFFICIENCY; ABSORPTION; FERMENTATION	Background Recent studies underscored that divergence in residual feed intake (RFI) in mature beef and dairy cattle is associated with changes in ruminal microbiome and metabolome profiles which may contribute, at least in part, to better feed efficiency. Because the rumen in neonatal calves during the preweaning period is underdeveloped until close to weaning, they rely on hindgut microbial fermentation to breakdown undigested diet components. This leads to production of key metabolites such as volatile fatty acids (VFA), amino acids, and vitamins that could potentially be absorbed in the hind-gut and help drive growth and development. Whether RFI divergence in neonatal calves is associated with changes in hindgut microbial communities and metabolites is largely unknown. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to determine differences in hindgut microbiome and metabolome in neonatal Holstein heifer calves retrospectively-grouped based on feed efficiency as most-efficient (M-eff) or least-efficient (L-eff) calves using RFI divergence during the preweaning period. Methods Twenty-six Holstein heifer calves received 3.8 L of first-milking colostrum from their respective dams within 6 h after birth. Calves were housed in individual outdoor hutches bedded with straw, fed twice daily with a milk replacer, and had ad libitum access to a starter grain mix from birth to weaning at 42 d of age. Calves were classified into M-eff [n = 13; RFI coefficient = - 5.72 +/- 0.94 kg DMI (milk replacer + starter grain)/d] and L-eff [n = 13; RFI coefficient = 5.61 +/- 0.94 kg DMI (milk replacer + starter grain)/d] based on a linear regression model including the combined starter grain mix and milk replacer DMI, average daily gain (ADG), and metabolic body weight (MBW). A deep sterile rectal swab exposed only to the rectum was collected immediately at birth before colostrum feeding (i.e., d 0), and fecal samples at d 14, 28, and 42 (prior to weaning) for microbiome and untargeted metabolome analyses using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and LC-MS. Microbiome data were analyzed with the QIIME 2 platform and metabolome data with the MetaboAnalyst 4.0 pipeline. Results No differences (P > 0.05) in body measurements including body weight (BW), body length (BL), hip height (HH), hip width (HW), and wither height (WH) were detected between M-eff and L-eff calves at birth and during preweaning. Although milk replacer intake did not differ between groups, compared with L-eff, M-eff heifers had lower starter intake (P < 0.01) between d 18 to 42 of age, whereas no differences (P > 0.05) for ADG, cumulative BWG, or body measurements were observed between RFI groups during the preweaning period. Microbiome and metabolome profiles through the first 42 d of age indicated greater hindgut capacity for the production of energy-generating substrates (butyrate and propionate) and essential nutrients (vitamins and amino acids) in heifers with greater estimated feed efficiency. Conclusion Despite consuming approximately 54.6% less solid feed (cumulative intake, 10.90 vs. 19.98 +/- 1.66 kg) from birth to weaning, the microbiome-metabolome changes in the hindgut of most-efficient heifers might have helped them maintain the same level of growth as the least-efficient heifers.

The aims of the study were to explore metabolic perturbations in autism, to investigate whether the severity of autism core symptoms may be associated with specific metabolic signatures; and to examine whether the urine metabolome discriminates severe from mild-to-moderate restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped behaviors. We enrolled 57 children aged 2-11 years; thirty-one with idiopathic autism and twenty-six neurotypical (NT), matched for age and ethnicity. The urine metabolome was investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The urinary metabolome of autistic children was largely distinguishable from that of NT children; food selectivity induced further significant metabolic differences. Severe autism spectrum disorder core deficits were marked by high levels of metabolites resulting from diet, gut dysbiosis, oxidative stress, tryptophan metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction. The hierarchical clustering algorithm generated two metabolic clusters in autistic children: 85-90% of children with mild-to-moderate abnormal behaviors fell in cluster II. Our results open up new perspectives for the more general understanding of the correlation between the clinical phenotype of autistic children and their urine metabolome. Adipic acid, palmitic acid, and 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxypropanoic acid can be proposed as candidate biomarkers of autism severity.

Plasma metabolomic profile in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension	PULMONARY CIRCULATION			English	Article						metabolism; lipolysis; ketogenesis; chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension	DENSITY-LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL; S-ADENOSYLHOMOCYSTEINE; ARTERIAL-HYPERTENSION; INSULIN-RESISTANCE; MECHANISMS; THROMBOSIS; OUTCOMES; DISEASE	We aimed to characterize the plasma metabolome of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension patients using a high-throughput unbiased omics approach. We collected fasting plasma from a peripheral vein in 33 operable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension patients, 31 healthy controls, and 21 idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension patients matched for age, gender, and body mass index. Metabolomic analysis was performed using an untargeted approach (Metabolon Inc. Durham, NC). Of the total of 862 metabolites identified, 362 were different in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension compared to controls: 178 were higher and 184 were lower. Compared to idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, 147 metabolites were different in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension: 45 were higher and 102 were lower. The plasma metabolome allowed us to distinguish subjects with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and healthy controls with a predictive accuracy of 89%, and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension versus idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension with 80% accuracy. Compared to idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension and healthy controls, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension patients had higher fatty acids and glycerol; while acyl cholines and lysophospholipids were lower. Compared to healthy controls, both idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension patients had increased acyl carnitines, beta-hydroxybutyrate, amino sugars and modified amino acids and nucleosides. The plasma global metabolomic profile of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension suggests aberrant lipid metabolism characterized by increased lipolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and ketogenesis, concomitant with reduced acyl choline and phospholipid moieties. Future research should investigate the pathogenetic and therapeutic potential of modulating lipid metabolism in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.

Macronutrient, Energy, and Bile Acid Metabolism Pathways Altered Following a Physiological Meal Challenge, Relative to Fasting, among Guatemalan Adults	JOURNAL OF NUTRITION			English	Article						metabolomics; meal challenge; fasting; postprandial; metabolic pathways	HIGH-RESOLUTION METABOLOMICS; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; NONFASTING TRIGLYCERIDES; PLASMA-CONCENTRATIONS; REVEALS DIFFERENCES; LIPID PROFILE; ORAL GLUCOSE; FATTY-ACIDS; NUTRITION; RESPONSES	Background: The healthy human metabolome, including its physiological responses after meal consumption, remains incompletely understood. One major research gap is the limited literature assessing how human metabolomic profiles differ between fasting and postprandial states after physiological challenges. Objectives: Our study objective was to evaluate alterations in high-resolution metabolomic profiles following a standardized meal challenge, relative to fasting, in Guatemalan adults. Methods: We studied 123 Guatemalan adults without obesity, hypertension, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, or comorbidities. Every participant received a standardized meal challenge (520 kcal, 67.4 g carbohydrates, 24.3 g fat, 8.0 g protein) and provided blood samples while fasting and at 2 h postprandial. Plasma samples were assayed by high-resolution metabolomics with dual-column LC [C18 (negative electrospray ionization), hydrophilic interaction LC (HILIC, positive electrospray ionization)] coupled to ultra-high-resolution MS. Associations between metabolomic features and the meal challenge timepoint were assessed in feature-by-feature multivariable linear mixed regression models. Two algorithms (mummichog, gene set enrichment analysis) were used for pathway analysis, and P values were combined by the Fisher method. Results: Among participants (62.6% male, median age 43.0 y), 1130 features (C18: 777; HILIC: 353) differed between fasting and postprandial states (all false discovery rate-adjusted q < 0.05). Based on differing C18 features, top pathways included: tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), primary bile acid biosynthesis, and linoleic acid metabolism (all P-combined < 0.05). Mass spectral features included: taurine and cholic acid in primary bile acid biosynthesis; and fumaric acid, malic acid, and citric acid in the TCA. HILIC features that differed in the meal challenge reflected linoleic acid metabolism (P-combined < 0.05).

The phytochemical constituents were determined, and multivariate data analysis discriminated the evaluated three parts into three groups according to the content of phenolics, flavonoids, flavonols, saponins, anthocyanins and tannins. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) profiling of polyphenols revealed the dominance of catechins, rutin and apigenin-7-glucosides in leaves, protocatechuin, p-hydroxybenzoic, syringic, vanillic, rosmarinic, p-coumaric acids and chrysin in male parts, and chlorogenic acid in fruits. Leaves and male parts showed stronger free radical scavenging activity than the fruits. Positive correlations between total antioxidant capacity and carbohydrates, phenolics and flavonols were observed. The three extracts exhibited potent anti-cancer activity against liver and lung carcinoma cell lines. All extracts exhibited antibacterial activity, while only fruits showed antifungal efficacy. In conclusion, H. thebaica leaves, male parts and fruits contain a variety of phytochemicals with antioxidant, anticancer and antimicrobial activities.

The chemical taxonomy and basic structural features of cellular metabolite can provide us a deeper understanding of bacterial tolerance at molecular level. Here, we used hierarchical classification and molecular composition analysis to investigate the metabolome responses ofE. faeciumto acid shock and nitrite stress. Our results showed that considerable high biodegradable compounds (e.g., dipeptides) were produced byE. faeciumunder acid shock, while nitrite stress induced the accumulations of some low biodegradable compounds (e.g., organoheterocyclic compounds and benzenoids). Complete genome analysis and metabolic pathway profiling suggested thatE. faeciumproduced high biodegradable metabolites responsible for the proton-translocation and biofilm formation, which increase its tolerance to acid shock. Yet, the presence of low biodegradable metabolites due to the nitrite exposure could disturb the bacterial productions of surface proteins, and thus inhibiting biofilm formation. Our approach uncovered the hidden interactions between intracellular metabolites and exogenous stress, and will improve the understanding of host-microbe interactions.

Decanoic Acid and Not Octanoic Acid Stimulates Fatty Acid Synthesis in U87MG Glioblastoma Cells: A Metabolomics Study	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						citric acid cycle; decanoic acid; lipid synthesis; metabolomics; octanoic acid	LIVER-MITOCHONDRIA; CHAIN; METABOLISM; PLASMA; OXIDATION; BINDING	Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) are dietary components with a chain length ranging from 6 to 12 carbon atoms. MCFA can cross the blood-brain barrier and in the brain can be oxidized through mitochondrial beta-oxidation. As components of ketogenic diets, MCFA have demonstrated beneficial effects on different brain diseases, such as traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, drug-resistant epilepsy, diabetes, and cancer. Despite the interest in MCFA effects, not much information is available about MCFA metabolism in the brain. In this study, with a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomics approach, coupled with multivariate data analyses, we followed the metabolic changes of U87MG glioblastoma cells after the addition of octanoic (C8), or decanoic (C10) acids for 24 h. Our analysis highlighted significant differences in the metabolism of U87MG cells after the addition of C8 or C10 and identified several metabolites whose amount changed between the two groups of treated cells. Overall, metabolic pathway analyses suggested the citric acid cycle, Warburg effect, glutamine/glutamate metabolism, and ketone body metabolism as pathways influenced by C8 or C10 addition to U87MG cells. Our data demonstrated that, while C8 affected mitochondrial metabolism resulting in increased ketone body production, C10 mainly influenced cytosolic pathways by stimulating fatty acid synthesis. Moreover, glutamine might be the main substrate to support fatty acids synthesis in C10-treated cells. In conclusion, we identified a metabolic signature associated with C8 or C10 addition to U87MG cells that can be used to decipher metabolic responses of glioblastoma cells to MCFA treatment.

Methods We collected 152 dried blood spot (DBS) specimens during the heating and non-heating seasons from 53 women who regularly used biomass-burning stoves for cooking and heating. Participants were enrolled in a longitudinal study in China. Untargeted metabolic phenotyping of DBS were generated using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry to exemplify measurement precision and assessment for feasibility to detect exposure to HAP, evaluated by season (high pollution vs. low pollution) and measured personal exposure to fine particulate matter <2.5 mu m diameters (PM2.5) and black carbon (BC) in the 48-h prior to collecting the DBS specimen. Results Metabolites e.g., amino acids, acyl-carnitines, lyso-phosphorylcholines, sphinganine, and choline were detected in the DBS specimens. Our approach is capable of detecting the differences in personal exposure to HAP whilst showing high analytical reproducibility, coefficient of variance (CV) <15%, meeting the U.S. Food and Drug Administration criteria. Conclusions Our results provide a proof of principle that high-resolution metabolic phenotypic data can be generated using a simple DBS extraction method thus suitable for exposure studies in remote, low-resource settings where the collection of serum and plasma is logistically challenging or infeasible. The analytical run time (19 min/specimen) is similar to most global phenotyping methods and therefore suitable for large-scale application.

However, the mechanisms of its protective effects through regulating endogenous metabolites remain unclear. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore the protective effects of DQTM on acute myocardial ischemia rats by comprehensive metabolomics profiling. Study design: The rats were divided into three groups: sham-operating, acute myocardial ischemia (AMI) and DQTM groups. The plasma and heart were collected and profiled by LC-MS based metabolomics and lipidomics. Based on the identified differential metabolites, the pathway analysis results were obtained and further validated using the network pharmacology approach. Methods: The AMI model was induced by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery. The metabolomics and lipidomics profiling were based on two established LC-QTOF/MS analysis methods. The raw data were processed using XCMS Online, then the differential metabolites with nonparametric t-test p value less than 0.05 were selected and identified using HMDB and METLIN. The pathway analysis was conducted using MetaboAnalyst and validated with the predicted network results obtained by BATMAN-TCM. Results: The metabolomics and lipidomics profiles of plasma and heart in response to AMI and DQTM were significantly different. The AMI operation had a serious influence on metabolites in heart ischemia region, while DQTM had a greater impact on lipids in heart non-ischemia region. A total of 151 differential metabolites were identified, including mainly amino acids and fatty acids. Multiple metabolic pathways were disturbed after AMI and could be restored by DQTM, of which arachidonic acid metabolism was further validated with the predicted results of network pharmacology. Conclusion: The protective effects of DQTM on acute myocardial ischemia rats could be achieved through the regulation of multiple metabolic pathways.

J	Song, D; Xu, C; Holck, AL; Liu, R				Song, Dan; Xu, Chao; Holck, Askild L.; Liu, Rong			Combining metabolomics with bioanalysis methods to investigate the potential toxicity of dihexyl phthalate	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY			English	Article						apoptosis; dihexyl phthalate (DHP); inflammation; LC-Q-TOF-MS; metabolic profiles	N-HEXYL PHTHALATE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; DNA-DAMAGE; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; MALE RATS; MS; DICYCLOHEXYL; METABOLITES; ESTERS; SPECTROMETRY	Dihexyl phthalate (DHP) is one of the most commonly used phthalate esters in various plastic and consumer products. Human are inevitably exposed to DHPs. Although several animal and human experiments have revealed that DHP can cause multiple toxicities, few studies have previously assessed the effects of DHP exposure by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis combine with molecular biology methods on human cells. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to investigate the effect of DHP on human cell metabolism by systems biology methods. In this study, U2OS cancer cells were treated with 10 mu M DHP for metabolomics analysis and apoptosis analysis at indicate time. Metabolomic study of the metabolic changes caused by DHP in U2OS cells was performed for the first time using integrative liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF-MS). To investigate the possible reason of fatty acids level altered by DHP, we measured some key fatty acid synthesis and oxidation-related enzyme expression levels by quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR). Apoptotic cells were analyzed by flow cytometry and apoptosis-related gene expressions were measured by Q-PCR. 2 ',7 '-Dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) staining was used to evaluate ROS content. Partial least squares-discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) clearly showed that significant differences in metabolic profiles were observed in U2OS cells exposed to DHP compared with controls. A total of 58 putative metabolites in electrospray ionization source (ESI) + mode and 32 putative metabolites in ESI-mode were detected, the majority of the differential metabolites being lipids and lipid-like molecules. Among them, the altered fatty acids level corresponded to expression levels of genes encoding enzymes related to fatty acids synthesis and oxidation. Moreover, DHP induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, promoted cell apoptosis and inflammation, and resulted in a significant increase in apoptosis and inflammation-related gene expression levels compared with controls. In summary, our results suggested that metabolomics combined with molecular bioanalysis methods could be an efficient tool to assess toxic effects, which contribute to explore the possible cytotoxicity mechanisms of DHP, and provide a basis for further research.

Identification of metabolic pathways is key to understanding the pathogenesis and mechanism of disease. Myocardial dysfunction induced by sepsis (SMD) is a severe complication of septic shock and represents major causes of death in intensive care units; however its pathological mechanism is still not clear. In this study, ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry-based metabolomics with chemometrics anaylsis and multivariate pattern recognition analysis were used to detect urinary metabolic profile changes in a lipopolysaccharide-induced SMD mouse model. Multivariate statistical analysis including principal component analysis and orthogonapartial least squares discriminant analysis for the discrimination of SMD was conducted to identify potential biomarkers. A total of 19 differential metabolites were discovered by high-resolution mass spectrometry-based urinary metabolomics strategy. The altered biochemical pathways based on these metabolites showed that tyrosine metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, ubiquinone biosynthesis and vitamin B6 metabolism were closely connected to the pathological processes of SMD. Consequently, integrated chemometric analyses of these metabolic pathways are necessary to extract information for the discovery of novel insights into the pathogenesis of disease.

Changes in cell type composition of skeletal muscle are associated with the development of metabolic diseases. Skeletal muscle cell types are currently distinguished by immunofluorescence (IF) staining based on myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform difference. However, it remains a challenge to provide metabolic fingerprints of different muscle cell types by IF staining. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a method to examine metabolite distribution within different cell types by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) with high spatial resolution. Skeletal muscle samples from C57/BL6 mice were obtained by slicing. Cell types in TOF-SIMS images were labelled corresponding to IF images from the same region of serially cut sections. Mass spectra corresponding to individual muscle cells were extracted to compare metabolic fingerprints among cell types. Skeletal muscle cells were classified into two clusters based on the mass spectra of individual cells. Unsaturated diacylglycerol (DG) and fatty acid (FA) species were found to be distributed in a cell-type dependent manner. Moreover, relative quantification showed that the content of unsaturated DGs, oleic acid and linoleic acid was higher in type I and type IIA cells than in type IIB cells. TOF-SIMS in combination with IF enables us to directly visualize metabolite distribution in different cell types, to find potential biomarkers for cell type classification. TOF-SIMS imaging coupled with IF staining has been proved to be a promising tool for metabolic fingerprinting of different skeletal muscle cell types.

Integrated omics analysis of sweat reveals an aberrant amino acid metabolism pathway in Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease	CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						autoimmune disease; multi-omics analysis; sweat; Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-disease	GENE POLYMORPHISMS; IMMUNE-RESPONSE; T-CELLS; DEFENSE; SUSCEPTIBILITY; ASSOCIATION; CYTOKINES; PATCHES; INNATE; PLASMA	Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease is an autoimmune disease leading to visual impairment. Its pathogenic mechanisms remain poorly understood. Our purpose was to investigate the distinctive protein and metabolic profiles of sweat in patients with VKH disease. In the present study, proteomics and metabolomics analysis was performed on 60 sweat samples (30 VKH patients and 30 normal controls) using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analysis was used to validate the results of our omics analysis. In total, we were able to detect 716 proteins and 175 metabolites. Among them, 116 proteins (99 decreased and 17 increased) were observed to be significantly different in VKH patients when compared to controls. Twenty-one differentially expressed metabolites were identified in VKH patients, of which 18 included choline, L-tryptophan, betaine and L-serine were reduced, while the rest were increased. Our multi-omics strategy reveals an important role for the amino acid metabolic pathway in the pathogenesis of VKH disease. Significant differences in proteins and metabolites were identified in the sweat of VKH patients and, to some extent, an aberrant amino acid metabolism pathway may be a pathogenic factor in the pathogenesis of VKH disease.

However, so far the limitation of metabolome coverage of analytical methods hinders comprehensive metabolite biomarker finding. Moreover, the widely used case-control comparison is not enough to unveil the detailed correlations of the metabolic changes with different sperm abnormalities. In this work, we aimed to have comprehensive metabolic profiling of seminal plasma to find the metabolomics difference between healthy controls and infertility case samples with different semen abnormities by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) detection with previously established new sample preparation procedure. Among 624 detected metabolite features, 63 potential biomarkers in various metabolite classes were found for infertility in seminal plasma by multivariate analysis. Interestingly, different infertility forms have different potential biomarkers with few in common, and most of potential biomarkers were found in oligo-astheno-teratospermia samples. To further find the association of the metabolomic changes with specific sperm abnormality, sperm parameters including sperm concentration, sperm deformity rate and sperm motility were also collected, and multivariate linear regression was used to find correlations between sperm parameters and potential biomarkers. Finally, levels of 17 metabolites were found to be significantly correlated with sperm parameters. Most of correlations agreed with previously reported mechanisms of infertility, such as correlation of acylcarnitines with sperm concentration and sperm deformity, and correlation of some antioxidants with sperm deformity rate and sperm motility. Some correlations were reported for the first time, such as negative correlations of isopentenyl pyrophosphate, 2-phosphoglyceric acid and gamma-glutamylSe-methylselenocysteine with sperm deformity rate, and negative correlation of creatine riboside with sperm concentration. All the potential biomarkers were involved in 14 metabolic pathways playing important role in energy production, antioxidation, hormone regulation and sperm membrane. These results proved previously reported molecular mechanism (such as oxidative stress and energy production) and also gave new possible clues to the pathology of male infertility, which will benefit future etiology, diagnosis and treatment of male infertility.

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are the main active constituents of ARR. Research on the metabolite profile of VOCs and the difference of absorbed constituents in vivo after an administration of ARR decoction and powder will be helpful to understand the pharmacological activity and safety of ARR. In this study, headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) was applied to profile the VOCs from ARR in rats in vivo. A total of 153 VOCs were tentatively identified; 101 were original constituents of ARR (98 in the powder-treated group and 43 in the decoction-treated group) and 15 were metabolites, and their metabolic reactions were mainly oxidation and reduction, with only two cases of methylation and esterification, and 37 unclassified compounds were identified only in the ARR-treated group. Of the 153 VOCs identified, 131 were reported in rats after oral administration of ARR for the first time, containing 79 original constituents, 15 metabolites, and 37 unclassified compounds. In the powder-treated group, methyleugenol, safrole, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene (3,5-DMT), 2,3,5-trimethoxytoluene (2,3,5-TMT), and 3,4,5-trimethoxytoluene (3,4,5-TMT) were the main absorbed constituents, the relative contents of which were significantly higher compared to the decoction-treated group, especially methyleugenol, safrole, and 3,5-DMT. In the decoction-treated group, 3,4,5-TMT, 2,3,5-TMT, kakuol, and eugenol were the main constituents with a higher content and wider distribution. The results of this study provide a reference for evaluating the efficacy and safety of ARR.

In this study, the effects of elevated silver nanoparticle (AgNPs) levels as a model system of heavy metals, in the presence of microalgal crude extracts (MCEs) at different ratios, were evaluated against the non-cancerous Vero cells, and the cancerous MCF-7 and 4T1 cells. The MCEs were developed from water (W) and ethanol (ETH) as green solvents. The AgNPs-MCEs-W at the 4:1 and 5:1 ratios (v/v) after 48 and 72 h treatment, respectively, showed the IC50 values of 83.17-95.49 and 70.79-91.20 mu g/ml on Vero cells, 13.18-28.18 and 12.58-25.7 mu g/ml on MCF-7; and 16.21- 33.88 and 14.79-26.91 mu g/ml on 4T1 cells. In comparison, the AgNPs-MCEs-ETH formulation achieved the IC50 values of 56.23-89.12 and 63.09-91.2 mu g/ml on Vero cells, 10.47-19.95 and 13.48-26.61 mu g/ml on MCF-7; 14.12-50.11 and 15.13-58.88 mu g/ml on 4T1 cells, respectively. After 48 and 72 h treatment, the AgNPs-MCE-CHL at the 4:1 and 5:1 ratios exhibited the IC50 of 51.28-75.85 and 48.97-69.18 mu g/ml on Vero cells, and higher cytotoxicity at 10.47-16.98 and 6.19-14.45 mg/ml against MCF-7 cells, and 15.84-31.62 and 12.58-24.54 mu g/ml on 4T1 cells, respectively. The AgNPs-MCEs-W and ETH resulted in low apoptotic events in the Vero cells after 24 h, but very high early and late apoptotic events in the cancerous cells. The Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry-Electrospray Ionization (LC-MS-ESI) metabolite profiling of the MCEs exhibited 64 metabolites in negative ion and 56 metabolites in positive ion mode, belonging to different classes. The microalgal metabolites, principally the anti-oxidative components, could have reduced the toxicity of the AgNPs against Vero cells, whilst retaining the cytotoxicity against the cancerous cells.

Use of Large and Diverse Datasets for H-1 NMR Serum Metabolic Profiling of Early Lactation Dairy Cows	METABOLITES			English	Article						NMR; metabotype; metabolomics; transition; ketosis; cattle; chemometrics; spectral correction	NUCLEAR-MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; MILK; CATTLE; PLASMA; SPECTROSCOPY; PERFORMANCE; HERDS; STAGE; ACID; TIME	Most livestock metabolomic studies involve relatively small, homogenous populations of animals. However, livestock farming systems are non-homogenous, and large and more diverse datasets are required to ensure that biomarkers are robust. The aims of this study were therefore to (1) investigate the feasibility of using a large and diverse dataset for untargeted proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) serum metabolomic profiling, and (2) investigate the impact of fixed effects (farm of origin, parity and stage of lactation) on the serum metabolome of early-lactation dairy cows. First, we used multiple linear regression to correct a large spectral dataset (707 cows from 13 farms) for fixed effects prior to multivariate statistical analysis with principal component analysis (PCA). Results showed that farm of origin accounted for up to 57% of overall spectral variation, and nearly 80% of variation for some individual metabolite concentrations. Parity and week of lactation had much smaller effects on both the spectra as a whole and individual metabolites (<3% and <20%, respectively). In order to assess the effect of fixed effects on prediction accuracy and biomarker discovery, we used orthogonal partial least squares (OPLS) regression to quantify the relationship between NMR spectra and concentrations of the current gold standard serum biomarker of energy balance, beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA). Models constructed using data from multiple farms provided reasonably robust predictions of serum BHBA concentration (0.05 <= RMSE <= 0.18). Fixed effects influenced the results biomarker discovery; however, these impacts could be controlled using the proposed method of linear regression spectral correction.	[Luke, Timothy D.

Fundamental questions regarding UPJO's mechanism, assessment, and treatment still remain unanswered. The aim of the present study was to elucidate potential differences through serum metabolic profiling of surgical cases of infants with UPJO compared to both nonsurgical cases and healthy age-matched controls. Early diagnosis of renal dysfunction in this cohort based on highlighted biomarkers was the ultimate goal. Thus, serum samples were collected from 20 patients preoperatively, 19 patients with mild stenosis treated conservatively, and 17 healthy controls. All samples were subjected to targeted metabolomics analysis by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HILIC LC-MS/MS). Both univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed.

In this study, untargeted metabolomics analysis was performed via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and the results were used to screen the antimicrobial compounds. A total of 236 differential metabolites were found among the BF stages compared with the white hyphal stage. Among them, five important antimicrobial metabolites related to antimicrobial activities, namely, 6-deoxyerythronolide B, tanikolide, hydroxyanthraquinone, benzylideneacetone, and 9-OxooTrE, were present at high levels in the BF samples. The score plots of the principal component analysis indicated that the samples from four time points could be classified into two groups. This study provided a comprehensive profile of the antimicrobial compounds produced during BF formation and partly clarified the antibacterial and antifungal mechanism of the BF of L. edodes mycelium.

However, the diagnosis of POCD is not very satisfactory as no specific biomarkers have been classified. It is necessary to identify new diagnostic markers to better understand the pathogenesis of POCD. We performed liquid chromatography with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer- (LC/Q-TOF-MS-) based metabolomics study to investigate POCD. A total of 40 metabolites were differentially expressed between POCD and non-POCD patients. In this study, we investigated whether phosphatidylserine (PS) (17:2/0:0), with an area under the curve value of 0.966, was a potential sensitive and specific biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of POCD. Pathway analysis showed that fatty acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and carnitine metabolism were significantly altered in POCD. Network analysis indicated that nitric oxide signaling, PI3K-AKT signaling, mTOR signaling, and mitochondrial dysfunction were related to the pathogenesis of POCD. This study showed that metabolic profiling was meaningful when studying the diagnosis and pathogenesis of POCD.

Time-dependent biomolecular responses and bioaccumulation of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in Daphnia magna	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY D-GENOMICS & PROTEOMICS			English	Article						Perfluoroalkyl substances; Aquatic toxicity; Metabolic profiling; Bioaccumulation; Zooplankton	BETA-BLOCKER PROPRANOLOL; PERFLUOROALKYL ACIDS; PERFLUORINATED COMPOUNDS; GENE-EXPRESSION; EXPOSURE; ZEBRAFISH; TOXICITY; PROTEIN; ACCUMULATION; ASSOCIATIONS	Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a persistent pollutant which is potentially harmful and bioaccumulative to aquatic organisms. To evaluate the regulatory alteration of select metabolites with PFOS exposure at early and typical acute exposure periods in an aquatic indicator species Daphnia magna, the hourly abundance of the twenty-three metabolites was investigated over 24 h. To evaluate the bioaccumulation potential of PFOS at a sub-lethal concentration in D. magna, the daily accumulation into D. magna for 16 days was also evaluated. Twenty-three targeted metabolites were quantified over 1 to 4 h and 21 to 24 h of PFOS exposure using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Daphnid to water PFOS concentration ratios were monitored separately over different days and life stages at 0 to 76 h and 2 to 16 days of PFOS exposure. The observed metabolite abundance and bioaccumulation in the exposed groups was compared between sampling times. The results reveal that sub-lethal PFOS exposure at 2 mg/L and 20 mg/L alters regulation of arginine, tyrosine and adenosine monophosphate which are directly and indirectly related to energy status. The temporal metabolic responses observed for the early exposure period (4 h), but not for the typical acute exposure period (24 h), suggest the dysregulation potency of PFOS on metabolite regulation of D. magna and the importance of early time-course monitoring approaches. Sixteen days of bioaccumulation monitoring showed that PFOS is more bioaccumulative in younger D. magna. The observation of time-dependent bioaccumulation of PFOS in D. magna requires further studies to define its precise mechanism. Interestingly, the bioaccumulation potential of PFOS was found to be consistent between 72 h and 16 day exposure periods. No difference on the body burden to water concentration ratio during about one third of the life span time (16 days), compared to the 72 h exposure, suggests that the prolonged exposure did not increase the bioaccumulation of PFOS in D. magna. This study demonstrates that the Daphnia metabolites are rapidly responding to sub-lethal PFOS exposure and provides information on life stage and time-dependent bioaccumulation potential of PFOS. As such, metabolite regulation is a sensitive indicator to sub-lethal PFOS exposure and can be informative when combined with other measures of toxicity.

Recently, it has been reported that entorhinal cortex (EC) functions on the regulation of depressive-like phenotype relying on the stimulation of glutamatergic afferent from EC to hippocampus. Based on this, we used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method to explore metabolic alterations in the EC of mice after exposed to chronic restraint stress (CRS). Molecular validation was conducted via the application of western blot and RT-qPCR. Through this study, we found significant upregulation of glutamate, ornithine aspartic acid, 5-hydroxytryptophan, L-tyrosine and norepinephrine in CRS group, accompanied with downregulation of homovanillic acid. Focusing on these altered metabolic pathways in EC, we found that gene levels of GAD1, GLUL and SNAT1 were increased. Upregulation of SERT and EAAT2 in protein expression level were also validated, while no significant changes were found in TH, AADC, MAOA, VMAT2, GAD1, GLUL and SNAT1. Our findings firstly provide evidence about the alteration of metabolites and related molecules in the EC of mice model of depression, implying the potential mechanism in MDD pathology.

In this study, nine different metabolites in the longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle of finishing pigs under heat stress were screened and identified. Through quantitative verification, it was concluded that the content of L-carnitine in the LD muscles of the finishing pigs could be significantly decreased due to heat stress, which might be a biomarker for monitoring the animal health status and muscle quality under heat stress. Abstract Heat stress (HS) negatively affects meat quality by affecting material and energy metabolism, and exploring the mechanism underlying the muscle response to chronic HS in finishing pigs is important for the global pork industry. This study investigated changes in the metabolic profiles of the longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle of finishing pigs under high temperature using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS) and multivariate data analysis (MDA). Castrated male DLY pigs (Duroc x Landrance x Yorkshire pigs, n = 24) from 8 litters were divided into three treatment groups: constant optimal ambient temperature at 22 degrees C and ad libitum feeding (CR, n = 8); constant high ambient temperature at 30 degrees C and ad libitum feeding (HS, n = 8); and constant optimal ambient temperature 22 degrees C and pair-feeding to the control pigs (PF, n = 8). The metabolic profile data from LD muscle samples were analyzed by MDA and external search engines. Nine differential metabolites (L-carnosine, acetylcholine, inosinic acid, L-carnitine, L-anserine, L-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine, acetylcarnitine, thiamine triphosphate, and adenosine thiamine diphosphate) were involved in antioxidant function, lipid metabolism, and cell signal transduction, which may decrease post mortem meat quality and play important roles in anti-HS. Four metabolites (L-carnosine, acetylcholine, inosinic acid, and L-carnitine) were verified, and it was indicated that the muscle L-carnitine content was significantly lower in HS than in CR (p < 0.01). The results show that constant HS affects the metabolites in the LD muscle and leads to coordinated changes in the endogenous antioxidant defense and meat quality of finishing pigs. These metabonomics results provide a basis for researching nutritional strategies to reduce the negative effects of heat stress on livestock and present new insights for further research.

Due to the highly complex regulation of cellular metabolism, definite identification of metabolic pathway alterations remains challenging and requires sophisticated experimentation. Methods We applied a comprehensive kinetic model of the central carbon metabolism (CCM) to characterise metabolic reprogramming in murine liver cancer. Results We show that relative differences of protein abundances of metabolic enzymes obtained by mass spectrometry can be used to assess their maximal velocity values. Model simulations predicted tumour-specific alterations of various components of the CCM, a selected number of which were subsequently verified by in vitro and in vivo experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the kinetic model to identify metabolic pathways whose inhibition results in selective tumour cell killing. Conclusions Our systems biology approach establishes that combining cellular experimentation with computer simulations of physiology-based metabolic models enables a comprehensive understanding of deregulated energetics in cancer. We propose that modelling proteomics data from human HCC with our approach will enable an individualised metabolic profiling of tumours and predictions of the efficacy of drug therapies targeting specific metabolic pathways.

First, a refined and translationally relevant model of DSS chronic colitis in C57BL/6 mice was established, and cecropin A and antibiotics were used as interventions. We found that the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, and IL-6 in the liver tissues of mice were highly increased in the context of DSS treatment but were lowered by cecropin A and antibiotics. Subsequently, an untargeted metabolomics analysis was performed by UPLC-Orbitrap-MS/MS to reveal the metabolic profile and attempt to find the potential therapeutic targets of the liver disorders that occur in IBD. Notably, 133 metabolites were identified by an integrated database. Metabolism network and pathway analyses demonstrated that the metabolic disturbance of the liver in IBD mice was mainly enriched in bile acid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and steroid hormone biosynthesis, while those disturbances were regulated or reversed through cecropin A and antibiotic treatment. Furthermore, the top 20 metabolites, such as glutathione, maltose, arachidonic acid, and thiamine, were screened as biomarkers via one-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA,p<0.05) coupled with variable importance for project values (VIP >1) of orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), which could be upregulated or downregulated with the cecropin A and antibiotics treatment. Spearman correlation analysis showed that the majority of the biomarkers have a significant correlation with cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-10), indicating that those biomarkers may act as potential targets to interact directly or indirectly with cecropin A and antibiotics to affect liver inflammation. Collectively, our results extend the understanding of the molecular alteration of liver disorders occurring in IBD and offer an opportunity for discovering potential therapeutic targets in the IBD process.

In Vitro Metabolic Profile Elucidation of Synthetic Cannabinoid APP-CHMINACA (PX-3)	JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL TOXICOLOGY			English	Article							HUMAN LIVER-MICROSOMES; HUMAN HEPATOCYTES; URINE SPECIMENS; MDMB-FUBINACA; ADB-FUBINACA; AB-FUBINACA; IDENTIFICATION; PINACA; 5F-ADB; INTOXICATION	Indazole carboxamide synthetic cannabinoids remain the most prevalent subclass of new psychoactive substances (NPS) reported internationally. However, the metabolic and pharmacological properties of many of these compounds remain unknown. Elucidating these characteristics allows members of the clinical and forensic communities to identify causative agents in patient samples, as well as render conclusions regarding their toxic effects. This work presents a detailed report on the in vitro phase I metabolism of indazole carboxamide synthetic cannabinoid APP-CHMINACA (PX-3). Incubation of APP-CHMINACA with human liver microsomes, followed by analysis of extracts via high-resolution mass spectrometry, yielded 12 metabolites, encompassing 7 different metabolite classes. Characterization of the metabolites was achieved by evaluating the product ion spectra, accurate mass and chemical formula generated for each metabolite. The predominant biotransformations observed were hydrolysis of the distal amide group and hydroxylation of the cyclohexylmethyl (CHM) substituent. Nine metabolites were amide hydrolysis products, of which five were monohydroxylated, one dihydroxylated and two were ketone products. The metabolites in greatest abundance in the study were products of amide hydrolysis with no further biotransformation (M1), followed by amide hydrolysis with monohydroxylation (M2.1). Three APP-CHMINACA-specific metabolites were generated, all of which were hydroxylated on the CHM group; one mono-, di- and tri-hydroxylated metabolite each was produced, with dihydroxylation (M6) present in the greatest abundance. The authors propose that metabolites M1, M2.1 and M6 are the most appropriate markers to determine consumption of APP-CHMINACA. The methods used in the current study have broad applicability and have been used to determine the in vitro metabolic profiles of multiple synthetic cannabinoids and other classes of NPS. This research can be used to guide analytical scientists in method development, synthesis of reference material, pharmacological testing of proposed metabolites and prediction of metabolic processes of compounds yet to be studied.

Here, we aimed to identify the critical metabolites associated with the outcomes and develop a risk score to assess the prognosis of HCC patients after curative resection. A total of 78 serum samples of HCC patients were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to characterize the metabolic profiling. A novel network-based feature selection method (NFSM) was developed to define the critical metabolites with the most discriminant capacity to outcomes. The metabolites defined by NFSM was further reduced by Cox regression analysis to generate a prognostic metabolite panel-phenylalanine and choline. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were applied to combine the metabolite panel with the presence of satellite nodes to generate a global prognostic index (GPI) score for overall survival assessment. Compared with the current clinical classification systems, including the Barcelona-clinic liver cancer stage, tumor-node-metastasis stage, and albumin-bilirubin grad; the GPI score presented comparable performance, according to the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves and was validated in an independent cohort, which suggested that metabolomics could serve as a helpful tool to stratify the HCC prognostic risk after operation.

Leaves containing more trichomes are considered to produce higher quality tea, but no evidence is available to support this opinion. In the present study, morphological and metabolic analyses of trichomes showed that tea trichomes were unicellular, simple, and rich in many water-soluble metabolites, including free catechins, caffeine, and amino acids. Furthermore, the analysis of known quality-related and non-targeted metabolites in fresh tea leaves and tea products showed that the presence of trichomes did not change the overall metabolite profiles of fresh tea leaves, white tea, and black tea, but might affect the non-targeted metabolites in green tea. Overall, more trichomes might only indicate higher quality tea leaves, while metabolites in the leaf might be the key factor. This study provides the first determination of the contribution of trichomes to tea quality.

Methods: Glycosaminoglycans were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify free oligosaccharides and identify 22 ceramide trihexosides and 23 sulfatides, which are integrated by 670 calculated ratios. Collaborative Laboratory Integrated Reports (CLIR; https://clir.mayo.edu) was used for post-analytical interpretation of the complex metabolite profile and to aid in the differential diagnosis of abnormal results. Results: Multiplex analysis was performed on 25 sulfatiduria case samples and compiled with retrospective data from an additional 15 cases revealing unique patterns of biomarkers for each disorder of sulfatide degradation (MLD, MSD, and Saposin B deficiency) and for MLII/III, thus allowing the formulation of a novel algorithm for the biochemical diagnosis of these disorders. Conclusions: Comprehensive and integrated urine screening could be very effective in the initial workup of patients suspected of having a lysosomal disorder as it covers disorders of sulfatide degradation and narrows down the differential diagnosis in patients with elevated glycosaminoglycans.

This work profiled the fecal metabolome of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and analyzed the potential roles of metabolites in the diagnosis and development of SLE. Fecal sample from 29 SLE patients without any other diseases and 30 healthy controls (HCs) were analyzed by metabolomics profiling. All participants took no antibiotics in the month before sampling and clinical data collecting. The metabolome profiles of patients with SLE and HCs were significantly different. Thirty fecal metabolites, such as deoxycholic acid, erucamide, L-tryptophan and putrescine, were significantly enriched, while nine metabolites, such as glyceric acid, gamma-tocopherol, (Z)-13-octadecenoic acid and 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, were depleted in SLE patients vs. HCs. The areas under the curve (AUCs) of L-valine, pyrimidine, erucamide, and L-leucine during ROC analysis were 0.886, 0.833, 0.829, and 0.803, indicating their good diagnostic potential. Moreover, the combination of L-valine, erucamide and 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol gave an AUC of 0.959. SLE-altered metabolites were significantly located in 28 pathways, such as ABC transporters (p= 3.40E-13) and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis (p= 2.11E-12). Furthermore, SLE-altered fecal metabolites were closely correlated with SLE indicators, e.g., L-tryptophan was positively correlated with the SLEDAI-2K (p= 0.007). Our results suggest that the SLE fecal metabolome is closely associated with the occurrence and development of SLE and is of great diagnostic value.

In this paper, the capability of polyphenolic berry extract (PBE) to inhibit MR in an ultra-high temperature (UHT) treated milk was investigated. Total polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity of blueberry (BE) and raspberry extracts (RE) were also tested. A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method was developed to monitor the MR product N epsilon-(carboxymethyl)-L-lysine (CML) and L-lysine (LYS). PBE was added to milk at 0.05 and 0.1% w/v prior to UHT processing. Data revealed that formation of CML was significantly reduced (23.4 +/- 5.1%) by addition of 0.1% w/v BE. The final concentrations of LYS measured following the addition of PBE prior to thermal treatment were statistically similar to the control milk which was not subjected to thermal processing. Additionally, the metabolic profile of milk samples was investigated by GC-MS and visualised using 'FancyTiles'.

Glucose signaling has been widely studied in the vascular plant Arabidopsis thaliana, but it has remained unexplored in non-vascular species such as Physcomitrella patens. To investigate P. patens response to high glucose treatment, we explored the dynamic changes in metabolism and protein population by applying a metabolomic fingerprint analysis (DIESI-MS), carbohydrate and chlorophyll quantification, Fv/Fm determination and label-free untargeted proteomics. Glucose feeding causes specific changes in P. patens metabolomic fingerprint, carbohydrate contents and protein accumulation, which is clearly different from those of osmotically induced responses. The maximal rate of PSII was not affected although chlorophyll decreased in both treatments. The biological process, cellular component, and molecular function gene ontology (GO) classifications of the differentially expressed proteins indicate the translation process is the most represented category in response to glucose, followed by photosynthesis, cellular response to oxidative stress and protein refolding. Importantly, although several proteins have high fold changes, these proteins have no predicted identity. The most significant discovery of our study at the proteome level is that high glucose increase abundance of proteins related to the translation process, which was not previously evidenced in non-vascular plants, indicating that regulation by glucose at the translational level is a partially conserved response in both plant lineages. To our knowledge, this is the first time that metabolome fingerprint and proteomic analyses are performed after a high sugar treatment in non-vascular plants. These findings unravel evolutionarily shared and differential responses between vascular and non-vascular plants.

To fully understand its mechanism of action, it is necessary to study the in vitro and in vivo metabolism. Methods For in vitro metabolism, GW1929 was incubated with rat hepatocytes at 37 degrees C for 2 h. For in vivo metabolism, rats were orally administered with GW1929 at a single dose of 10 mg/kg and plasma, urinary and fecal samples were collected at defined time points. All the samples were analyzed by the developed ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry. The structures of metabolites were proposed according to their accurate masses and product ions. Results A total of 17 metabolites, including seven glucuronide conjugates, were detected and structurally identified. M4 (hydroxylation), M13 (demethylation) and M14 (hydroxylation) were the most abundant metabolites. The metabolic pathways of GW1929 referred to hydroxylation, demethylation, deamination and glucuronidation. Conclusions The present study provided new information on the in vitro and in vivo metabolic profiles of GW1929 which will be helpful for a better understanding of the mechanism of the elimination of GW1929.

The association between milk metabolites and infant outcomes has not been thoroughly investigated. Objectives: This study aimed to quantify maternal adiposity-related differences in the human milk metabolome and to identify metabolites associated with infant adiposity during the first 6 mo postpartum using untargeted metabolomics. Method: Maternal anthropometrics were assessed <= 14 weeks of gestation. Human milk samples were collected at 0.5 mo (n = 159), 2 mo (n = 131), and 6 mo (n = 94) postpartum from normal weight (NW, BMI = 185-24.9 kg/m 2 ) and obese (OB, BMI >30 kg/m(2)) mothers. GC-time-of-flight-MS was used to identify metabolic signatures that discriminate NW and OB women. Partial least squared (PLS)-discriminant analysis, and PLS -regression models were assessed to examine relations between metabolites and maternal BMI and fat mass. Metabolites altered by maternal obesity were used in linear mixed effect models to predict infant adiposity. Results: Multivariate modeling identified 23. 17, and 10 metabolites that described maternal adiposity indices at 0.5 mo, 2 mo, and 6 mo postpartum, respectively. Monosaccharides and sugar alcohols were the most representative annotated metabolite classes that were increased in milk from OB women and included: mannose, ribose, lyxose. lyxitol (0.5 mo); mannose. ribitol, glycerol, isothreonic acid. lyxitol (2 mo); lyxitol and isothreonic acid (6 mo). Other discriminant metabolites included: 1-monostearin, xylonolactone, shikimic acid, pseudo uridine, and dodecanol (0.5 mo); N-acetyl-1)-hexosamine and fumaric acid (2 mo): uric acid and tyrosine (6 mo). Mannose, lyxitol, and shikimic acid predicted higher infant adiposity over the first 6 mo of life. Conclusions: This study reports on 1 of the largest cohorts to date examining the metabolic profiles in human milk comparing NW and OB women. Maternal adiposity was associated with increased amounts of milk nonglucose monosaccharides. Human milk metabolomics may be useful in predicting infant adiposity.

GC-MS based comparative metabolomic analysis of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cancer cells treated with Tamoxifen and/or Paclitaxel	JOURNAL OF PROTEOMICS			English	Article						Metabolomics; MCF-7; MDA-MB-231; Breast cancer cells; Gas chromatography; mass spectrometry (GC-MS); Tamoxifen; And paclitaxel	FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; HUMAN BREAST-CANCER; PROGESTERONE-RECEPTOR; ESTROGEN-RECEPTOR; MECHANISM; CHEMOTHERAPY; PATHWAY; HER-2	Breast cancer cells MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 were treated with Tamoxifen (5 mu M) or Paclitaxel (1 mu M) or with a combination of the two drugs. Herein, we have employed gas chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy to identify metabolic changes occurring as response to different drug treatments. We report the identification of sixty-one metabolites and overall the two studied cell lines showed a distinct metabolomic profile from each other. Further data analysis indicates that a total of 30 metabolites were significantly differentially abundant in MCF-7 drug-treated cells, most of the metabolic changes occurred when cells were treated with either Tamoxifen (15) or Paclitaxel (25). On the other side, a total of 31 metabolites were significantly differentially abundant in MDA-MB-31 cells with drug treatment. Similarly, to MCF-7 most of the metabolic changes occurred when cells were treated with either Tamoxifen (19) or Paclitaxel (20). In conclusion, this report demonstrates that Tamoxifen and/or Paclitaxel treatment have a pronounced effect on the main metabolic pathways in both breast cancer (BC) cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB231), which could be used as a foundation for future investigations to understand the possible effect of these drugs on different metabolic pathways. Significance: Metabolic profiling of cancer cells is a promising tool in tumor diagnosis, biomarker discovery and drug treatment protocols, since cancer cells exhibit altered metabolism when compared to normal cells. Although numerous studies have reported the use of various OMICs applications to investigate breast cancer cells, very few of these have performed thorough screening of metabolites in such cells. Our investigation highlights the first study to characterize MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cancer cells treated with Tamoxifen and/or Paclitaxel and to identify the affected metabolic pathways. Such findings might play an important role in revealing the molecular bases of the underlying mechanism of action of these two frontline anti-breast cancer drugs.

To reveal the ultrastructural and metabolic differences in Se-induced Cd tolerance, we examined the ultrastructures of chloroplasts and root cells and characterised 155 differentially expressed metabolites under Cd and/or Se stress using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomics. Exogenous Se greatly relieved Cd-caused injuries to the ultrastructures of cucumber leaves and roots; for example, the shapes of chloroplasts treated with Cd + Se improved or even began to return to normal, the nuclei of root cells began to regenerate better and the chromatin was well-distributed compared with plants treated with Cd alone. Metabolite profiling revealed several intermediates of glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle; also, some amino acids were up-accumulated in Cd + Se-treated cucumber seedlings and down-accumulated in Cd-treated cucumber seedlings, such as pyruvic acid, galactose, lactose, glutaric acid and alanine in leaves, glucose-6-phosphate and serine in roots, and lactic acid and glycine in both leaves and roots. These metabolites may play dominant roles in developing Se-mediated Cd tolerance. Moreover, a high level of sugars and polyols, amino acids and organic acids were up-accumulated in Cd-treated plants. Meanwhile, our data suggest that high accumulation of fructose, alpha-ketoglutaric acid, shikimic acid, fumaric acid and succinic acid in roots is a Cd-specific response, indicating that these metabolites are vital for cucumbers to develop Cd resistance. This study extends the current understanding of the mechanisms of Se in abating Cd contamination in cucumber and demonstrates that metabolomics profiling provides a more comprehensive view of the response of plants to heavy metals.

Although many new candidate biomarkers have emerged in the last decades for different foods from metabolic profiling studies, the number of comprehensively validated biomarkers of food intake is limited. Apples are among the most frequently consumed fruits and a rich source of polyphenols and fibers, an important mediator for their health-protective properties. Methods Using an untargeted metabolomics approach, we aimed to identify biomarkers of long-term apple intake and explore how apples impact on the human plasma and urine metabolite profiles. Forty mildly hypercholesterolemic volunteers consumed two whole apples or a sugar and energy-matched control beverage, daily for 8 weeks in a randomized, controlled, crossover intervention study. The metabolome in plasma and urine samples was analyzed via untargeted metabolomics. Results We found 61 urine and 9 plasma metabolites being statistically significant after the whole apple intake compared to the control beverage, including several polyphenol metabolites that could be used as BFIs. Furthermore, we identified several endogenous indole and phenylacetyl-glutamine microbial metabolites significantly increasing in urine after apple consumption. The multiomic dataset allowed exploration of the correlations between metabolites modulated significantly by the dietary intervention and fecal microbiota species at genus level, showing interesting interactions between Granulicatella genus and phenyl-acetic acid metabolites. Phloretin glucuronide and phloretin glucuronide sulfate appeared promising biomarkers of apple intake; however, robustness, reliability and stability data are needed for full BFI validation. Conclusion The identified apple BFIs can be used in future studies to assess compliance and to explore their health effects after apple intake. Moreover, the identification of polyphenol microbial metabolites suggests that apple consumption mediates significant gut microbial metabolic activity which should be further explored.

J	Chong, FC; Chua, LS				Chong, Fung Chun; Chua, Lee Suan			Effects of Solvent and pH on Stingless Bee Propolis in Ultrasound-Assisted Extraction	AGRIENGINEERING			English	Article						Heterotrigona itama; stingless bees; propolis; ultrasound-assisted extraction; 2; 4-di-tert-butylphenol; mangostin; mangiferin		Ultrasound-assisted extraction was used to extract propolis from a dark and resinous substance harvested from a beehive of Heterotrigona itama, which is commonly known as stingless bees. The propolis extracts were prepared using ethanol and water at different pH values of 3, 6, and 9. The yield of the ethanolic extract was significantly higher than the water extract, but there were no significant differences at different pH values. The ethanolic extract was found to have a lower 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity than the water extract at pH values of 6 and 9. However, the acidic propolis extracts, particularly the ethanolic extract, were found to have the highest antioxidant capacity. The addition of 20% polyethylene glycol 400 in the solvent systems was unlikely to improve propolis extraction. This can be seen from the antioxidant capacity and metabolite profile of the propolis extracts. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based high throughput screening of the propolis extracts showed them to have small metabolites of hydrocarbons, esters, terpenes, and alkaloids, as well as high antioxidative 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol. The detection of mangostin, mangiferin, and a few flavanones in the acidic ethanolic extract by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry LC-MS/MS proved its high antioxidant capacity compared to the water extract.

This strategy allowed the detection of five metabolites of citalopram including 3-hydroxycitalopram and 3-oxocitalopram which were found as a new and not previously described metabolites of this drug The photocatalytic simulation of metabolism was carried out using tungsten (VI) oxide nanopowders with the different particle sizes, which allowed to examine the effect of this photocatalyst parameter on the mapping of metabolic processes. The accurate characterization of all observed structures was possible due to the use of ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry combined system as a highly useful technique in drug metabolism studies. In order to perform the toxicity prediction of citalopram and its metabolites, the acute toxicity to rodents, as well as genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, developmental toxicity and receptor-mediated toxicity was calculated basing on the in silico tools.

However, it remains to be applied to the ocular surface diseases, where biological samples are often of limited quantities. We successfully performed proof-of-concept metabolomics assessment of volume-limited cytology samples from a clinical form of chronic inflammatory cicatrizing conjunctivitis, i.e., ocular MMP and discovered metabolic changes of signaling lipid mediators upon disease onset and progression. The metabolomics assessment revealed active oxylipins, lysophospholipids, fatty acids, and endocannabinoids alterations, from which potential biomarkers linked to inflammatory processes were identified. Possible underlying mechanisms such as dysregulated enzyme activities (e.g., lipoxygenases, cytochrome P450, and phospholipases) were suggested which may be considered as potential therapeutic targets in future studies. Key messages Metabolic profile of the ocular surface can be measured using impression cytology samples. Metabolomics analysis of ocular pemphigoid is presented for the first time. The metabolomics assessment of OCP patients revealed active oxylipins, lysophospholipids, fatty acids, and endocannabinoids alterations. Several oxylipins are identified as diagnostic biomarkers for OCP.

Kynurenines link chronic inflammation to functional decline and physical frailty	JCI INSIGHT			English	Article							PERFORMANCE LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; INDOLEAMINE 2,3-DIOXYGENASE; OLDER-ADULTS; QUINOLINIC ACID; HUMAN-BRAIN; MICE; TRYPTOPHAN; MORTALITY; PATHWAY; 3-HYDROXYKYNURENINE	Chronic inflammation is associated with physical frailty and functional decline in older adults; however, the molecular mechanisms of this linkage are not understood. A mouse model of chronic inflammation showed reduced motor function and partial denervation at the neuromuscular junction. Metabolomic profiling of these mice and further validation in frail human subjects showed significant dysregulation in the tryptophan degradation pathway, including decreased tryptophan and serotonin, and increased levels of some neurotoxic kynurenines. In humans, kynurenine strongly correlated with age, frailty status, TNF-alpha R1 and IL-6, weaker grip strength, and slower walking speed. To study the effects of elevated neurotoxic kynurenines on motor neuronal cell viability and axonal degeneration, we used motor neuronal cells treated with 3-hydroxykynurenine and quinolinic acid and observed neurite degeneration in a dose-dependent manner and potentiation of toxicity between 3-hydroxykynurenine and quinolinic acid. These results suggest that kynurenines mediate neuromuscular dysfunction associated with chronic inflammation and aging.

The results showed the identification of 29 phytochemical compounds belonging to 13 classes of compounds and 20 tripeptides using High Resolution-Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (HR-LCMS). 13R-hydroxy-9E,11Z octadecadienoic acid, dihydrosamidin, valtratum, and cepharantine were the main compounds identified. The tested extract showed promising antioxidant activities (ABTS-IC50 = 0.042 mg/mL; 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)-IC50 = 0.087 mg/mL, beta-carotene-IC50 = 0.101 mg/mL and FRAP-IC50 = 0.292 mg/mL). Using both malignant Walker 256/B and MatLyLu cell lines, T. polium methanolic extract showed a dose/time-dependent antitumor activity. The molecular docking approach revealed that most of the identified molecules were specifically binding with human peroxiredoxin 5, human androgen, and human progesterone receptors with high binding affinity scores. The obtained results confirmed that T. polium is a rich source of bioactive molecules with antioxidant and antitumor potential.

Much attention has been focused on the impact of secondary metabolites in the host plant or fungi on these interactions. Plants and fungi contain a variety of biologically active compounds, and the secondary metabolite profile can vary significantly between individual samples. However, many experiments characterize the biological effects of only a single secondary metabolite or a subset of these compounds. Here, we develop an exhaustive extraction protocol using an accelerated solvent extraction protocol to recover the complete suite of cyclopeptides and other secondary metabolites found in Amanita phalloides (death cap mushrooms) and compare its efficacy to the "Classic" extraction method used in earlier works. We demonstrate that our extraction protocol recovers the full suite of cyclopeptides and other secondary metabolites in A. phalloides unlike the "Classic" method that favors polar cyclopeptides.

The molecular mechanisms which increase the risk of EC in PCOS are unclear. Derangements in lipid metabolism are associated with EC, but there have been no studies, investigating if this might increase the risk of EC in PCOS. This was a cross-sectional study of 102 women in three groups of 34 (PCOS, EC and controls) at Nottingham University Hospital, UK. All participants had clinical assessments, followed by obtaining plasma and endometrial tissue samples. Lipidomic analyses were performed using liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and the obtained lipid datasets were screened using standard software and databases. Using multivariate data analysis, there were no common markers found for EC and PCOS. However, on univariate analyses, both PCOS and EC endometrial tissue samples showed a significant decrease in monoacylglycerol 24:0 and capric acid compared to controls. Further studies are required to validate these findings and investigate the potential role of monoacylglycerol 24:0 and capric acid in the link between PCOS with EC.

Previous studies have observed that disturbances of gut microbiome may attribute to the development of MG through fecal metabolomic signatures in humans. However, whether there were differential gut microbial and fecal metabolomic phenotypes in different subtypes of MG remains unclear. Here, our objective was to explore whether the microbial and metabolic signatures of ocular (OMG) and generalized myasthenia gravis (GMG) were different, and further identify the shared and distinct markers for patients with OMG and GMG. In this study, 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) were performed to capture the microbial and metabolic signatures of OMG and GMG, respectively. Random forest (RF) classifiers was used to identify the discriminative markers for OMG and GMG. Compared with healthy control (HC) group, GMG group, but not OMG group, showed a significant decrease in alpha-phylogenetic diversity. Both OMG and GMG groups, however, displayed significant gut microbial and metabolic disorders. Totally, we identified 20 OTUs and 9 metabolites specific to OMG group, and 23 OTUs and 7 metabolites specific to GMG group. Moreover, combinatorial biomarkers containing 15 discriminative OTUs and 2 differential metabolites were capable of discriminating OMG and GMG from each other, as well as from HCs, with AUC values ranging from 0.934 to 0.990. In conclusion, different subtypes of MG harbored differential gut microbiota, which generated discriminative fecal metabolism.

However, metabolomic responses to realistic environmental conditions can be hindered by factors intrinsic to the environment and the organism. Hence, a well-designed experimental exposure associated with adequate statistical analysis could be helpful to better characterize and relate the observed variability to its different origins. In the current study, we applied a multifactorial experiment combined to Analysis of variance Multiblock Orthogonal Partial Least Squares (AMOPLS), to assess the metabolic response of wild marine mussels,Mytilus galloprovincialis, exposed to a wastewater treatment plant effluent, considering gender as an experimental factor. First, the total observed variability was decomposed to highlight the contribution of each effect related to the experimental factors. Both the exposure and the interaction gender x exposure had a statistically significant impact on the observed metabolic alteration. Then, these metabolic patterns were further characterized by analyzing the individual variable contributions to each effect. A main change in glycerophospholipid levels was highlighted in both males and females as a common response, possibly caused by oxidative stress, which could lead to reproductive disorders, whereas metabolic alterations in some polar lipids and kynurenine pathway were rather gender-specific. This may indicate a disturbance in the energy metabolism and immune system only in males. Finally, AMOPLS is a useful tool facilitating the interpretation of complex metabolomic data and is expected to have a broad application in the field of ecotoxicology.

Our study intends to investigate the leaves metabolic profile using Q-TOF LC/MS/MS (Quadrupole-Time-of-Flight-Liquid-Chromatography-Mass-Spectrometry), and to explore their in vivo hepatoprotective activity in rats using CCL4-induced hepatic damage model and silymarin as standard. Fifty metabolites were characterized, belonging to different classes; coumarins (capensine, daphnoretin, and scopoletin), flavonoids (mainly quercetin and apigenin glycosides), phenolic acids (cinnamic acid and quinic acid derivatives) and amino acids (adenosine, homoisoleucine, and phenylalanine).These compounds are detected in the leaves for the first time. The hepatoprotective activity at three doses (200, 400, and 800 mg/kg) was investigated. The dose of 800 mg/Kg showed the highest hepatoprotective effect as it reduced the elevated serum levels of ALT, AST, NO, and TNF-alpha liver content by 26, 24, 23, and 42%, respectively, it also remarkably increased the serum level of catalase by 102%. All the tested doses showed higher reduction in serum level of TNF-alpha compared to silymarin which suggests their strong anti-inflammatory potential. M. glabra leaves are revealed to be a rich source of secondary metabolites and proved to possess significant hepatoprotective potential. Practical applications The performed analyses in this study shows the richness of Malpighia glabra Linn. leaves in a plethora of beneficial and safe phytochemicals which are well-known to have a pivotal role in protection against different diseases including liver disorders. The carried-out investigations were done using Q-TOF LC/MS/MS analysis which is a reliable technique for the determination, characterization and identification of bioactive metabolites; in addition to evaluation of the hepatoprotective effect of the leaves. Therefore, this study may emphasize that Malpighia glabra Linn. leaves may have the same nutritional and medicinal importance as its fruits, and they could be incorporated into pharmaceuticals and foods instead of discarding them.

Although LSG promotes sufficient weight loss, how LSG changes plasma metabolites remains unclear. We assessed changes in plasma metabolite levels after LSG. We collected plasma samples from 15 morbidly obese Japanese patients before and 3 months after LSG. A total of 48 metabolites were quantified using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry-based metabolomic profiling. Branched chain amino acids, several essential amino acids, choline, 2-hydroxybutyric acid, 2-oxoisovaleric acid and hypoxanthine were significantly decreased after LSG. Tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites, including citric acid, succinic acid and malic acid, were significantly elevated after LSG. This is the first report to show dynamic alterations in plasma metabolite concentrations, as assessed using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry, in morbidly obese patients after LSG. Our results might show how LSG helps improve obesity, in part through metabolic status changes, and propose novel therapeutic targets to ameliorate obesity.

Baill., which has been used as a remedy to prevent oxidative injury. However, whether the cardioprotective effect of SA is associated with regulating endogenous metabolites remains unclear, thus we performed comprehensive metabolomics profiling in acute myocardial ischemia (AMI) mice following SA treatment. AMI was induced in ICR mice by coronary artery ligation, then SA (6 mg center dot kg(-1)center dot d(-1), ip) was administered. SA treatment significantly decreased the infarct size, preserved the cardiac function, and improved the biochemical indicators and cardiac pathological alterations. Moreover, SA (10, 100 M) significantly decreased the apoptotic index in OGD-treated H8c2 cardiomycytes in vitro. By using HPLC-Q-TOF/MS, we conducted metabonomics analysis to screen the significantly changed endogenous metabolites and construct the network in both serum and urine. The results revealed that SA regulated the pathways of glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, lysine biosynthesis, pyrimidine metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis under the pathological conditions of AMI. Furthermore, we selected the regulatory enzymes related to heart disease, including ecto-5'-nucleotidase (NT5E), guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase (GAMT), platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF) and methionine synthase (MTR), for validation. In addition, SA was found to facilitate PI3K/Akt activation and inhibit the expression of NOX2 in AMI mice and OGD-treated H9c2 cells. In conclusion, we have elucidated SA-regulated endogenous metabolic pathways and constructed a regulatory metabolic network map. Furthermore, we have validated the new potential therapeutic targets and underlying molecular mechanisms of SA against AMI, which might provide a reference for its future application in cardiovascular diseases.

Thus, this study aimed to determine the metabolomic fingerprint of Spondias mombin and Spondias tuberosa leaves based on the use of reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled to a high-resolution mass spectrometer (UPLC-HRMS). The analysis by UPLC-HRMS allowed the annotation of 31 metabolites. The multivariate analysis allowed us to identify the biomarkers responsible for the distinction between species. Also, we correlate the biomarkers of S. mombin and S. tuberosa as supposed responsible for the difference in the degree of cytotoxicity between them. The in silico evaluation was performed to give more consistency to the correlation between biomarkers and cytotoxicity, which were compared to commercial drugs. Therefore, this study showed that S. mombin has the potential to become an input for the pharmaceutical industry as a source of raw material that can positively impact the sectors of agricultural production.

J	Wang, B; Gao, R; Wu, Z; Yu, Z				Wang, Bing; Gao, Run; Wu, Zhe; Yu, Zhu			Functional Analysis of Sugars in Modulating Bacterial Communities and Metabolomics Profiles of Medicago sativa Silage	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						alfalfa; metabolomics; microbial community; pectin; triterpenes aglycones	LACTIC-ACID PRODUCTION; SP NOV.; ALFALFA; PLANT; PERFORMANCE; QUALITY; INOCULANT; SEQUENCES; WEISSELLA; SAPONINS	This study explored the effects of four sugar source treatments, including no sugar (CON), fructose (FRU), pectin (PEC), and starch (STA), on the microbiota and metabolome of alfalfa (Medicago sativa) silage. The bacterial community was determined via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The metabolome was analyzed using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC/TOF-MS). After 60 days of fermentation, the pH values in FRU and PEC were lower than those in STA and CON. FRU had a greater lactic acid concentration compared to STA and CON. Weissella (47.44%) and Lactobacillus (42.13%) were the dominant species in all four groups. The abundance of Pediococcus was lower, and the abundance of Leuconostoc, Pantoea, and Microbacterium was higher, in FRU compared to CON. The abundance of norank_f__Bacteroidales_S24-7_group was higher, and the abundance of Turicibacter was lower, in both FRU and PEC than in CON. Leuconostoc was negatively correlated with the pH value, and Pediococcus was positively correlated with the pH value. No microbiomes were detected as discriminative features between STA and CON. The addition of FRU and PEC presented more peptides, such as Leu-Val-Thr, Leu-Phe, Ile-Pro-Ile, Val-Trp, and Ile-Leu-Leu but a lower abundance of metabolites for triterpene glycosides including sanchinoside B1, medicagenic acid, betavulgaroside IV, and prosapogenin compared to CON. The addition of PEC presented more phenyllactic acid compared to CON. Our study demonstrated that the addition of pectin and fructose improved the quality of alfalfa silage mainly by promoting Leuconostoc, Pantoea, and Microbacterium, and inhibiting Pediococcus in FRU, and promoting norank_f__Bacteroidales_S24-7_group and inhibiting Turicibacter in both FRU and PEC; this was due to altered metabolic profiles resulting from antifungal activity and decreased triterpene glycoside accumulation. This study improves our understanding of ensiling mechanisms related to the contributions of sugar.

Identification of Rosellinia species as producers of cyclodepsipeptide PF1022 A and resurrection of the genus Dematophora as inferred from polythetic taxonomy	STUDIES IN MYCOLOGY			English	Article						Xylariaceae; Rosellinia; Dematophora; Genus resurrection; Polythetic taxonomy; PF1022A; Isopimarane diterpenoids	FRUITING BODIES; MYROCIN-B; XYLARIACEAE; HYPOXYLON; PHYLOGENIES	Rosellinia (Xylariaceae) is a large, cosmopolitan genus comprising over 130 species that have been defined based mainly on the morphology of their sexual morphs. The genus comprises both lignicolous and saprotrophic species that are frequently isolated as endophytes from healthy host plants, and important plant pathogens. In order to evaluate the utility of molecular phylogeny and secondary metabolite profiling to achieve a better basis for their classification, a set of strains was selected for a multi-locus phylogeny inferred from a combination of the sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), the large subunit (LSU) of the nuclear rDNA, beta-tubulin (TUB2) and the second largest subunit of the RNA polymerase II (RPB2). Concurrently, various strains were surveyed for production of secondary metabolites. Metabolite profiling relied on methods with high performance liquid chromatography with diode array and mass spectrometric detection (HPLC-DAD/MS) as well as preparative isolation of the major components after re-fermentation followed by structure elucidation using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and high resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS). Two new and nine known isopimarane diterpenoids were identified during our mycochemical studies of two selected Dematophora strains and the metabolites were tested for biological activity. In addition, the nematicidal cyclodepsipeptide PF1022 A was purified and identified from a culture of Rosellinia corticium, which is the first time that this endophyte-derived drug precursor has been identified unambiguously from an ascospore-derived isolate of a Rosellinia species. While the results of this first HPLC profiling were largely inconclusive regarding the utility of secondary metabolites as genus-specific chemotaxonomic markers, the phylogeny clearly showed that species featuring a dematophora-like asexual morph were included in a well-defined Glade, for which the genus Dematophora is resurrected. Dematophora now comprises all previously known important plant pathogens in the genus such as D. arcuata, D. bunodes, D. necatrix and D. pepo, while Rosellinia s. str comprises those species that are known to have a geniculosporium-like or nodulisporium-like asexual morph, or where the asexual morph remains unknown. The extensive morphological studies of L.E. Petrini served as a basis to transfer several further species from Rosellinia to Dematophora, based on the morphology of their asexual morphs. However, most species of Rosellinia and allies still need to be recollected in fresh state, cultured, and studied for their morphology and their phylogenetic affinities before the infrageneric relationships can be clarified.

Spatially Controlled Molecular Analysis of Biological Samples Using Nanodroplet Arrays and Direct Droplet Aspiration	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR MASS SPECTROMETRY			English	Article							IONIZATION MASS-SPECTROMETRY; MOUSE-BRAIN; CANCER; CARRYOVER; DIAGNOSIS	Mass spectrometry (MS) has emerged as a valuable technology for molecular and spatial evaluation of biological samples. Ambient ionization MS techniques, in particular, allow direct analysis of tissue samples with minimal pretreatment. Here, we describe the design and optimization of an alternative ambient liquid extraction MS approach for metabolite and lipid profiling and imaging from biological samples. The system combines a piezoelectric picoliter dispenser to form solvent nanodroplets onto the sample surface with controlled and tunable spatial resolution and a conductive capillary to directly aspirate/ionize the nanodroplets for efficient analyte transmission and detection. Using this approach, we performed spatial profiling of mouse brain tissue sections with different droplet sizes (390, 420, and 500 mu m). MS analysis of normal and cancerous human brain and ovarian tissues yielded rich metabolic profiles that were characteristic of disease state and enabled visualization of tissue regions with different histologic composition. This method was also used to analyze the lipid profiles of human ovarian cell lines. Overall, our results demonstrate the capabilities of this system for spatially controlled MS analysis of biological samples.

It is of essential relevance for any interactions and metabolism on the tooth surface. Up to now, there is no information on the metabolome of this structure. Accordingly, the present study aims to characterise the metabolomic profile of in-situ pellicle in children with different caries activity for the first time in comparison to saliva. Small molecules such as carbohydrates, amino acids, organic acids, and fatty acids, putatively involved in the formation of caries were quantified using mass spectrometry (MS)-based techniques, such as (stable isotope dilution analysis)-ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem MS and gas chromatography/electron ionisation-MS. Pellicle and corresponding saliva samples were collected from caries-active, caries-free and caries-rehabilitated 4- to 6-year-old children. The most abundant analytes in pellicle were acetic acid (1.2-10.5 nmol/cm(2)), propionic acid (0.1-8.5 nmol/cm(2)), glycine (0.7-3.5 nmol/cm(2)), serine (0.08-2.3 nmol/cm(2)), galactose (galactose+mannose; 0.035-0.078 nmol/cm(2)), lactose (0.002-0.086 nmol/cm(2)), glucose (0.018-0.953 nmol/cm(2)), palmitic acid (0.26-2.03 nmol/cm(2)), and stearic acid (0.34-1.81 nmol/cm(2)). Significant differences depending on caries activity were detected neither in saliva nor in the corresponding pellicle samples.

However, the detailed metabolic mechanism and potential pathways of Schisandrin B effects on myocardial injury are unclear. Metabolomics could yield in-depth mechanistic insights and explore the potential therapeutic effect of natural products. In this study, the preparation of doxorubicin-induced myocardial injury rat model for evaluation of Schisandrin B on viral myocarditis sequelae related pathological changes and its mechanism. The metabolite profiling of myocardial injury rats was performed through ultra-high performance liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry combined with pattern recognition approaches and pathway analysis. A total of 15 metabolites (nine in positive ion mode and six in negative ion mode) were considered as potential biomarkers of myocardial injury, and these metabolites may correlate with the regulation of Schisandrin B treatment. A total of six metabolic pathways are closely related to Schisandrin B treatment, including glycerophospholipid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, purine metabolism, etc. This study revealed the potential biomarkers and metabolic network pathways of myocardial injury, and illuminated the protective mechanism of Schisandrin B on myocardial injury.

However, an in-depth understanding of the chemical constituents of QLP and its in vivo metabolic study is lacking. In this study, a method using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF-MS) was established for comprehensive analysis of chemical constituents of QLP and their metabolites in plasma, urine, bile and feces after gastric perfusion. The method guaranteed the fast discovery of representative structural fragment information and provided efficient structure clues for identification based on data from MSE mode. As a result, a total of 202 constituents were unambiguously identified or tentatively characterized. In addition, a total of 203 QLP-related xenobiotics were characterized, including 41 (22 prototypes and 19 metabolites) in plasma, 144 (47 prototypes and 97 metabolites) in urine, 50 (27 prototypes and 23 metabolites) in bile and 68 (51 prototypes and 17 metabolites) in feces. The metabolism reactions included phase I reactions (demethylation, hydroxylation, deglycosylation, deoxygenation, hydrogenation, dehydration, oxidation and hydrolysis) and phase II reactions (methylation, conjugation with glucuronide and sulfate). This was the first comprehensive investigation on chemical constituents and metabolic profiles of QLP in vivo, and the results provided chemical foundation for further research on effective substances and action mechanism of QLP.

The aim of this work was to develop an adsorption procedure for the quantitative recovery of polyphenols from fresh orange juice. Different macroporous resins have been selected to evaluate their affinity for phenolic compound in order to purify the antioxidant compounds from the orange juice. The main compounds of orange juice were firstly characterized using an UPLC-UV-HRMS to define the metabolite profile, and subsequently three different types of adsorbent (XAD-2, XAD-4, and XAD-16N) were tested to concentrate these bioactive compounds. The time of contact was selected based on kinetic studies, and subsequently the adsorption and elution conditions were optimized in order to maximize the recovery of phenolic compounds to obtain an extract rich of bioactive compounds. Lastly, antioxidant capacity of the orange juice extract of selected macroporous resin, obtained under optimized conditions, was determined by in vitro antioxidant assays.

The metabolic phenotype of regulatory T cells (Treg) is affected by various factors. The relationship between Treg metabolism and function of mice with sepsis is not clear. We used liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to analyze the metabolic profiles of freshly-isolated spleen Treg cells in mice with sepsis. It was found that in severe infection, activated Treg cells depend on glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation, and inhibition of metabolic pathways has a significant impact on the number and quality of Treg cells. Understanding the metabolic characteristics of Treg cells in the real environment in the body helps to grasp the function of Treg cells and even the overall immune status. Targeting the metabolic pathway of Treg may provide a new method for the treatment of sepsis.

Initial symptoms are unspecific and belated thus increasing mortality. Moreover, current diagnostic and monitoring tools are harmful for the patient and unspecific in low-grade tumors. Therefore, novel minimally-invasive markers are needed to diagnose and monitor RCC patients. Urine represents the ideal sample source of non-invasive biomarkers for RCC. In our study we aimed to identify a urine metabolomic profile characteristic of RCC patients with diagnostic purposes and also to identify a profile with prognostic value. By an UPLC-Q-ToF MS untargeted metabolomic analysis, we compared the metabolomic profile of 23 RCC patients (14 clear cell RCC and 9 papillary RCC) before surgery and that of 23 healthy controls. Additionally, for the first time, we compared the metabolomic profile of these RCC patients pre-nephrectomy and 3 months and one year post-nephrectomy. We identified the dysregulated metabolomic variables by querying their exact mass against those presented in the Metlin and Human Metabolome Database. Next, we experimentally confirmed their identity. Both RCC subtypes showed similar metabolomic patterns at all stages. 51 metabolomic variables were significantly increased in RCC compared to controls and, among them, 4 were selected as potential discriminant metabolites between groups. We could experimentally confirm the identity of p-cresol glucuronide thus describing for the first time an increase in this metabolite in urine of RCC patients (fold change = 2.922, P=.012). Additionally, we confirmed that no metabolomic differences occur 3 months post-nephrectomy in RRC, while 188 variables were significantly increased one year post-nephrectomy. Of the 15 most discriminant metabolomic variables, we could experimentally confirm the identity of isobutyryl-L-carnitine (fold change = 2.098, P=.004) and L-proline betaine (fold change = 3.328, P=.004), for the first time. In summary, we have identified urine p-cresol glucuronide as potential diagnostic marker for RCC and isobutyryl-L-carnitine and L-proline betaine as potential prognostic markers. When confirmed in an independent cohort of RCC patients, these markers may improve the diagnosis and monitoring of RCC patients thus reducing current harmful diagnostic procedures. Significance: The high-radiation dose of current imaging techniques available to diagnose and monitor renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are harmful for the patient and unspecific in low-grade tumors. Our untargeted metabolomic analysis carried out in urine samples from RCC patients and healthy individual reveals p-cresol glucuronide as potential diagnostic marker for RCC. Additionally, the analysis of RCC urine samples one year post-nephrectomy reveals isobutyryl-L-carnitine and L-proline betaine as potential prognostic markers. These novel non-invasive urine biomarkers may improve RCC management thus reducing the use of current harmful diagnostic techniques.

A probiotic blend was found to alleviate intestinal complications caused by the medicine. To gain more extensive insight into the beneficial effects of the probiotic blend, we investigated the changes in metabolite levels using a non-targeted metabolic approach with ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole/time-of-fligh (UPLC-q/TOF) mass spectrometry. Analysis of lipid metabolites revealed that rats that received AMD had a different metabolome profile compared with control rats and rats that received AMD plus the probiotic blend. In the AMD-administered group, serum levels of phosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins, triglycerides with large numbers of double bonds, cholesterols, sterol derivatives, and cholesterol esters (all p < 0.05) were increased compared with those of the control group and the group that received AMD plus the probiotic blend. The AMD-administered group also exhibited significantly decreased levels of triglycerides with small numbers of double bonds (all p < 0.05). These results support our hypothesis that AMD-induced compositional changes in the gut microbiota are a causal factor in inflammation.

It is therefore important to search for new chemical compounds to detect cancer state. Laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry on gold nanoparticle-enhanced target (AuNPET) method was used in this work for rapid metabolic analysis of blood serum of fifty patients with renal cancer. Comparison with data from sera of fifty healthy volunteers allowed discovering potential biomarkers of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Statistical analysis of m/z values that had the greatest impact on group differentiation allowed. Database search allowed providing assignment of signals for the most promising eleven features among them: dihydrouracil, creatinine, glutamine, tyrosine, 2,3-diaminosalicylic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenine, 2-hydroxylauroylcarnitine, melatonin glucuronide, palmitoyl glucuronide, triglyceride(52:4) or phosphatidylcholine(42:0). This work demonstrate that the differences in metabolite profiles in serum of kidney cancer patients and that of healthy subjects could be identified by gold nanostructures LDI MS - based metabolomics and exploited as metabolic serum markers for the early detection of kidney cancer.

We aimed to identify metabolic fingerprints and their associated pathways that discriminate women with MHO with high or low weight loss response after a lifestyle intervention, based on a hypocaloric Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) and physical activity. Methods: A UPLC-Q-Exactive-MS/MS metabolomics workflow was applied to plasma samples from 27 women with MHO before and after 12 months of a hypocaloric weight loss intervention with a MedDiet and increased physical activity. The subjects were stratified into two age-matched groups according to weight loss: <10% (low weight loss group, LWL) and >10% (high weight loss group, HWL). Random forest analysis was performed to identify metabolites discriminating between the LWL and the HWL as well as within-status effects. Modulated pathways and associations between metabolites and anthropometric and biochemical variables were also investigated. Results: Thirteen metabolites discriminated between the LWL and the HWL, including 1,5-anhydroglucitol, carotenediol, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactic acid, N-acetylaspartate and several lipid species (steroids, a plasmalogen, sphingomyelins, a bile acid and long-chain acylcarnitines). 1,5-anhydroglucitol, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactic acid and sphingomyelins were positively associated with weight variables whereas N-acetylaspartate and the plasmalogen correlated negatively with them. Changes in very long-chain acylcarnitines and hydroxyphenyllactic levels were observed in the HWL and positively correlated with fasting glucose, and changes in levels of the plasmalogen negatively correlated with insulin resistance. Additionally, the cholesterol profile was positively associated with changes in acid hydroxyphenyllactic, sphingolipids and 1,5-AG. Conclusions: Higher weight loss after a hypocaloric MedDiet and increased physical activity for 12 months is associated with changes in the plasma metabolome in women with MHO. These findings are associated with changes in biochemical variables and may suggest an improvement of the cardiometabolic risk profile in those patients that lose greater weight. Further studies are needed to investigate whether the response of those subjects with MHO to this intervention differs from those with unhealthy obesity.

In this study, we explored if the metabolic rewiring also alters the metabolite content of cancer-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). For this, metabolomes of EVs from different cancers (prostate, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and colon cancer cell lines) were compared with the metabolomes of control EVs derived from matched non-cancerous cell lines. The metabolomes of EVs from all three cancer types significantly differed from their respective control EVs by elevated levels of proline and succinate. Additionally, prostate and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cell line -derived EVs contained elevated levels of creatinine and folate when compared to controls. In conclusion, this study presents the first evidence that a shared panel of metabolites in EVs reflects the altered metabolic state of multiple cancer cell types in vitro. These results warrant further studies of the significance and usability of a metabolic fingerprint in cancer studies and for biomarker discovery. Cancer alters cell metabolism. How these changes are manifested in the metabolite cargo of cancer-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) remains poorly understood. To explore these changes, EVs from prostate, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), colon cancer cell lines, and control EVs from their noncancerous counterparts were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation and analyzed by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), electron microscopy (EM), Western blotting, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Although minor differences between the cancerous and non-cancerous cell-derived EVs were observed by NTA and Western blotting, the largest differences were detected in their metabolite cargo. Compared to EVs from noncancerous cells, cancer EVs contained elevated levels of soluble metabolites, e.g., amino acids and B vitamins. Two metabolites, proline and succinate, were elevated in the EV samples of all three cancer types. In addition, folate and creatinine were elevated in the EVs from prostate and CTCL cancer cell lines. In conclusion, we present the first evidence in vitro that the altered metabolism of different cancer cells is reflected in common metabolite changes in their EVs. These results warrant further studies on the significance and usability of this metabolic fingerprint in cancer.

Ion peaks in the chromatograms of four biological replicates of the vegetable leaves were processed using the alignment software PowerGet for metabolite comparison, from which we obtained the potential chemical formulae. In total, 860 ion peaks were reproducibly detected; of these, 506, 525, and 336 peaks were found in the hybrid, A. tuberosum, and A. fistulosum, respectively. There were 130 peaks specific to the hybrid; from these, 31 metabolites were annotated by searching compound databases. The sulfur-containing compounds and flavonoids were further analyzed using bioinformatics, to examine the sulfur metabolism of Allium volatiles and the flavonoid pathways in these species. In conclusion, our metabolome analysis of this interspecies hybrid and its parents provides a unique opportunity to elucidate their metabolic background.

In this work, metabolite profiling with the use of direct spectroscopic techniques (mass spectrometry/MS, infrared spectroscopy/IR, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy/NMR) and gas chromatography (GC) were combined with multivariate statistical analysis to find a pattern for distinguishing H. perforatum from other Hypericum species (H. annulatul, H. calycinum, H. hirsutum, H. hookerianum, H. humifusum, H. maculatum, H. olympicum and H. pseudohenryi). The PCA (Principal Component Analysis) of the multivariate data showed that PC2 versus PC3 facilitated distinguishing commercial Hypericum samples and H. perforatum from other Hypericum species. Moreover, PC2 versus PC3 revealed by the GC data showed high similarity with the HPLC results.

Integrated Metabolomics and Transcriptomics Suggest the Global Metabolic Response to 2-Aminoacrylate Stress in Salmonella enterica	METABOLITES			English	Article						2-aminoacrylate stress; RidA; pyridoxal 5 '-phosphate; metabolic networks; metabolomics; H-1 NMR	ESCHERICHIA-COLI; UNTARGETED METABOLOMICS; FAMILY; YJGF; BIOSYNTHESIS; GROWTH; RIDA; ACID; ACCUMULATION; SENSITIVITY	In Salmonella enterica, 2-aminoacrylate (2AA) is a reactive enamine intermediate generated during a number of biochemical reactions. When the 2-iminobutanoate/2-iminopropanoate deaminase (RidA; EC: 3.5.99.10) is eliminated, 2AA accumulates and inhibits the activity of multiple pyridoxal 5'-phosphate(PLP)-dependent enzymes. In this study, untargeted proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) metabolomics and transcriptomics data were used to uncover the global metabolic response of S. enterica to the accumulation of 2AA. The data showed that elimination of RidA perturbed folate and branched chain amino acid metabolism. Many of the resulting perturbations were consistent with the known effect of 2AA stress, while other results suggested additional potential enzyme targets of 2AA-dependent damage. The majority of transcriptional and metabolic changes appeared to be the consequence of downstream effects on the metabolic network, since they were not directly attributable to a PLP-dependent enzyme. In total, the results highlighted the complexity of changes stemming from multiple perturbations of the metabolic network, and suggested hypotheses that will be valuable in future studies of the RidA paradigm of endogenous 2AA stress.

Objective To study the association between the external load, defined by variables obtained using electronic performance tracking systems (EPTS), and the urinary metabolome as a surrogate of the metabolic adaptation to training. Methods Urine metabolic and EPTS data from 80 professional football players collected in an observational longitudinal study were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and assessed by partial least squares (PLS) regression. Results PLS models identified steroid hormone metabolites, hypoxanthine metabolites, acetylated amino acids, intermediates in phenylalanine metabolism, tyrosine, tryptophan metabolites, and riboflavin among the most relevant variables associated with external load. Metabolic network analysis identified enriched pathways including steroid hormone biosynthesis and metabolism of tyrosine and tryptophan. The ratio of players showing a deviation from the PLS model of adaptation to exercise was higher among those who suffered a muscular lesion compared to those who did not. Conclusions There was a significant association between the external load and the urinary metabolic profile, with alteration of biochemical pathways associated with long-term adaptation to training. Future studies should focus on the validation of these findings and the development of metabolic models to identify professional football players at risk of developing muscular injuries.

Polyamines are closely associated with proliferation and inflammation, and steroid hormones are involved in immune responses. Additionally, bile acids play roles in immune homeostasis by activating various signaling pathways; however, the roles of these substances and their metabolites in alopecia areata remain unclear. Objectives In this study, we aimed to identify differences in metabolite levels in urine samples from patients with alopecia areata and healthy controls. Methods To assess polyamine, androgen, and bile acid concentrations, we performed high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results Our results showed that spermine and dehydroepiandrosterone levels differed significantly between male patients and controls, whereas ursodeoxycholic acid levels were significantly higher in female patients with alopecia areata than in controls. Conclusion Our findings suggested different urinary polyamine, androgen, and bile acid concentrations between alopecia areata patients and normal controls. Additionally, levels of endogenous substances varied according to sex, and this should be considered when developing appropriate treatments and diagnostic techniques. Our findings improve our understanding of polyamine, androgen, and bile acid profiles in patients with alopecia areata and highlight the need to consider sex-related differences.

The wheat stem sawfly (Cephus cinctus, WSS) is a major wheat pest, and while partial resistance has been deployed by breeding for a solid-stem trait, this trait is affected by environment. Here, a proteomics and metabolomics study was performed on four wheat cultivars to characterize a molecular response to WSS infestation. The cultivars Hatcher (hollow-stem partially tolerant), Conan (semisolid-stem-resistant), and Denali and Reeder (hollow-stem-susceptible) were infested with WSS, and changes in stem proteins and metabolites were characterized using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The proteome was characterized as 1830 proteins that included five major biological processes, including metabolic processes and response to stimuli, and the metabolome (1823 metabolites) spanned eight chemical super-classes, including alkaloids, benzenoids, and lipids. All four varieties had a molecular response to WSS following infestation. Hatcher had the most distinct changes, whereby 62 proteins and 29 metabolites varied in metabolic pathways involving enzymatic detoxification, proteinase inhibition, and antiherbivory compound production via benzoxazinoids, neolignans, and phenolics. Taken together, these data demonstrate variation in the wheat stem molecular response to WSS infestation and support breeding for molecular resistance in hollow-stem cultivars.

Comparison of DNA analysis, targeted metabolite profiling, and non-targeted NMR fingerprinting for differentiating cultivars of processed olives	FOOD CONTROL			English	Article						Olive; Cultivar; DNA; Fatty acid; Phenolic; NMR	PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; OLEA-EUROPAEA; TABLE OLIVES; LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; GEOGRAPHICAL ORIGIN; OILS; IDENTIFICATION; FRUIT; CLASSIFICATION; SPECTROSCOPY	Genetic and metabolite analyses have been frequently employed in food traceability studies, although their effectiveness in heavily-processed products such as canned olives is uncertain. A robust method for identifying cultivars of processed table olives is necessary to ensure product authenticity and economic fairness. This study compared microsatellite analysis, fatty acid profiling, phenolic profiling, and NMR fingerprinting for differentiating cultivars of California-style olives. Methods were tested on domestic Manzanilla, domestic Sevillano, imported Hojiblanca, and imported Gordal olives. Microsatellites were successfully amplified in all cultivars except Hojiblanca, and Sevillano/Gordal were found to be genetically-related, possibly synonyms for the same genetic cultivar. Coupled with multivariate statistics, fatty acid profiling differentiated the three genetically-distinct cultivars, and NMR fingerprinting differentiated all four cultivars. Phenolic profile showed too much variability for effective discrimination. Future work includes expanding current models by size, cultivars, and type of table olive.

However, automated steps for multi-omics analyses and interpretation of histological images have not yet been implemented in mass spectrometry data analysis workflows. The characterization of molecular properties within cellular and histological features is done via time-consuming, nonobjective, and irreproducible definitions of regions of interest, which are often accompanied by a loss of spatial resolution due to mass spectra averaging. Methods: We developed a new imaging pipeline called Spatial Correlation Image Analysis (SPACiAL), which is a computational multimodal workflow designed to combine molecular imaging data with multiplex immunohistochemistry (IHC). SPACiAL allows comprehensive and spatially resolved in situ correlation analyses on a cellular resolution. To demonstrate the method, matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization (MALDI) Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) imaging mass spectrometry of metabolites and multiplex IHC staining were performed on the very same tissue section of mouse pancreatic islets and on human gastric cancer tissue specimens. The SPACiAL pipeline was used to perform an automatic, semantic-based, functional tissue annotation of histological and cellular features to identify metabolic profiles. Spatial correlation networks were generated to analyze metabolic heterogeneity associated with cellular features. Results: To demonstrate the new method, the SPACiAL pipeline was used to identify metabolic signatures of alpha and beta cells within islets of Langerhans, which are cell types that are not distinguishable via morphology alone. The semantic-based, functional tissue annotation allows an unprecedented analysis of metabolic heterogeneity via the generation of spatial correlation networks. Additionally, we demonstrated intra- and intertumoral metabolic heterogeneity within HER2/neu-positive and -negative gastric tumor cells. Conclusions: We developed the SPACiAL workflow to provide IHC-guided in situ metabolomics on intact tissue sections. Diminishing the workload by automated recognition of histological and functional features, the pipeline allows comprehensive analyses of metabolic heterogeneity. The multimodality of immunohistochemical staining and extensive molecular information from imaging mass spectrometry has the advantage of increasing both the efficiency and precision for spatially resolved analyses of specific cell types. The SPACiAL method is a stepping stone for the objective analysis of high-throughput, multi-omics data from clinical research and practice that is required for diagnostics, biomarker discovery, or therapy response prediction.

This study aimed to explore whether salivary metabolites could help discriminate between breast cancer patients and healthy controls. Saliva samples from 23 breast cancer patients and 35 healthy controls were subjected to untargeted metabolomics using liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and a bioinformatics tool (XCMS Online), which revealed 534 compounds, characterized by their retention time in reverse-phase liquid chromatography and by the m/z ratio detected, that were shared by the two groups. Using the METLIN database, 31 compounds that were upregulated in the breast cancer group (p < 0.05) were identified, including seven oligopeptides and six glycerophospholipids (PG14:2, PA32:1, PS28:0, PS40:6, PI31:1, and PI38:7). In addition, pre-treatment and post-treatment saliva samples were analyzed for 10 patients who experienced at least a partial response to their treatment. In these patients, three peptides and PG14:2 were upregulated before but not after treatment. The area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity for PG14:2 was 0.7329, 65.22%, and 77.14%, respectively. These results provide new information regarding the salivary metabolite profiles of breast cancer patients, which may be useful biomarkers.

Owing to lack of data on its prototypes and metabolites, elucidation of the pharmacological and clinically safe levels of this formula has been significantly hindered. To screen more potential bioactive components of Jiao-Tai-Wan, we identified its multiple prototypes and metabolites in the plasma of type 2 diabetic rats by ultra high performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A total of 47 compounds were identified in the plasma of type 2 diabetic rats, including 22 prototypes and 25 metabolites, with alkaloids constituting the majority of the absorbed prototype components. In addition, this is the first study to detect vanillic acid, gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, protocatechuic acid, 2-hydroxycinnamic acid, 3-hydroxycinnamic acid, 4-hydroxycinnamic acid, and 2-methoxy cinnamic acid after oral administration of Jiao-Tai-Wan. The prototypes from Jiao-Tai-Wan were extensively metabolized by demethylation, hydroxylation, and reduction in phase ROMAN NUMERAL ONE metabolic reactions and by methylation or conjugation of glucuronide or sulfate in phase II reactions. This is the first systematic study on the components and metabolic profiles of Jiao-Tai-Wan in vivo. This study provides a useful chemical basis for further pharmacological research and clinical application of Jiao-Tai-Wan.

Exploring yeast interactions through metabolic profiling	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							NON-SACCHAROMYCES YEASTS; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; ENOLOGICAL PROPERTIES; MIXED CULTURE; WINE; CEREVISIAE; STRAINS; FERMENTATIONS; POLYPHENOLS; SIMULATION	As a complex microbial ecosystem, wine is a particularly interesting model for studying interactions between microorganisms as fermentation can be done by microbial consortia, a unique strain or mixed culture. The effect of a specific yeast strain on its environments is unique and characterized by its metabolites and their concentration. With its great resolution and excellent mass accuracy, ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry (uHRMS) is the perfect tool to analyze the yeast metabolome at the end of alcoholic fermentation. This work reports the change in wine chemical composition from pure and mixed culture fermentation with Lachancea thermotolerans, Starmerella bacillaris, Metschnikowia pulcherrima and S. cerevisiae. We could clearly differentiate wines according to the yeast strain used in single cultures and markers, which reflect important differences between the yeast species, were extracted and annotated. Moreover, uHRMS revealed underlining intra species metabolomics differences, showing differences at the strain level between the two Starmerella bacillaris. Non volatile metabolomics analysis of single and sequential fermentations confirmed that mixed fermentations lead to a different composition. Distinct metabolites appeared in wines from sequential fermentation compared to single fermentation. This suggests that interactions between yeasts are not neutral.

The high molecular weight compounds viscotoxins and lectins are considered to be the main active substances in the extracts. However, a vast number of small molecules (<= 1500 Da) is also expected to be present, and few studies have investigated their identities. In this study, a comprehensive metabolome analysis of samples of fermented aqueous extracts ofV. albumfrom two host tree species (Malus domesticaandPinus sylvestris), both prepared by two pharmaceutical manufacturing processes, was performed by liquid chromatography-high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS). A total of 212 metabolites were putatively annotated, including primary metabolites (e.g., amino acids, organic acids, etc.) and secondary metabolites (mostly phenolic compounds). A clear separation betweenV. albumsamples according to the host tree species, but not due to manufacturing processes, was observed by principal component analysis. The biomarkers responsible for this discrimination were assessed by partial least squares-discriminant analysis. BecauseV. albumextracts from different host trees have different clinical applications, the present work highlights the possibility of characterizing the metabolome for identification and traceability ofV. albumfermented aqueous extracts.

However, compared to other industrially important microorganisms, the Z. mobilis metabolome and adaptation to various nutritional and genetic perturbations have been poorly characterized. For rational metabolic engineering, it is essential to understand how central metabolism and intracellular redox balance are maintained in Z. mobilis under various conditions. In this study, we applied quantitative mass spectrometry-based metabolomics to explore how glucose-fed non-growing Z. mobilis Zm6 cells metabolically adapt to change of oxygen availability. Mutants partially impaired in ethanol synthesis (Zm6 adhB) or oxidative stress response (Zm6 cat) were also examined. Distinct patterns of adaptation of central metabolite pools due to the change in cultivation condition and between the mutants and Zm6 reference strain were observed. Decreased NADH/NAD ratio under aerobic incubation corresponded to higher concentrations of the phosphorylated glycolytic intermediates, in accordance with predictions of the kinetic model of Entner-Doudoroff pathway. The effects on the metabolite pools of aerobic to anaerobic transition were similar in the mutants, yet less pronounced.

Most approved drugs can only alleviate some of the symptoms of AD, but no interventions have been found that reverse the underlying disease mechanisms. Rhodiola crenulata extract (RCE) has been reported to alleviate AD symptoms in rats. However, its underlying mechanism of action is still unclear. Methods A brain lipidomics study was conducted to investigate the protective effects of RCE against AD in rats to identify potential biomarkers of AD using Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) coupled with high-performance reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC). Differences in lipid metabolism profiles were evaluated using multivariate statistical analysis. Finally, the possible mechanism of action of RCE on AD was investigated by analysing metabolic pathways. Results The RPLCHILIC/FT-ICR MS results showed 20 lipid components with significant differences between the control and model groups. After administration of RCE, the levels of 10 lipids in AD rats tended to shift toward reference levels. The pathway analysis revealed that the protective effect of RCE against AD might be related to regulation of glycerophospholipid metabolism. Conclusions This study provides a novel perspective on the potential intervention mechanism of RCE in the treatment of AD.

Robust and reproducible data are essential for confidence in analytical results and are particularly important with large-scale studies. Commercial kits are now available which use carefully calibrated and validated internal and external standards to provide such reliability. However, they are still subject to processing and technical errors in their use and should be subject to a laboratory's routine quality assurance and quality control measures to maintain confidence in the results. We discuss important systematic and random measurement errors when using these kits and suggest measures to detect and quantify them. We demonstrate how wider analysis of the entire data set alongside standard analyses of quality control samples can be used to identify outliers and quantify systematic trends to improve downstream analysis. Finally, we present the MeTaQuaC software which implements the above concepts and methods for Biocrates kits and other target data sets and creates a comprehensive quality control report containing rich visualization and informative scores and summary statistics. Preliminary unsupervised multivariate analysis methods are also included to provide rapid insight into study variables and groups. MeTaQuaC is provided as an open source R package under a permissive MIT license and includes detailed user documentation.

Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects ofApium graveolensL. extracts mitigate against fatal acetaminophen-induced acute liver toxicity	JOURNAL OF FOOD BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						acetaminophen; acute liver failure; celery; hydroxyl radical quenching; Kaplan-Meier survival analysis; metabolite profiling	APIUM-GRAVEOLENS; PROTECTIVE ROLE; IN-VITRO; CELERY; SUPPRESSION	In the present work, antioxidant activity, total phenolics (TP), and total flavonoids (TF) contents of aqueous and methanol extracts of celery were determined, in addition to untargeted metabolites profiling its methanol celery root extract (MCRE) via UPLC-MS. Although MCRE exhibited the lowest TPC and TFC levels, it presented the most potential hydroxyl radical quenching effect using electron paramagnetic resonance spin trapping technique. Treatment of Acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity (AAH) rats with MCRE lowered serum levels of AST, ALT, ALP, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta significantly. Additionally, MCRE significantly increased total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and glutathione (GSH) levels relative to AAH rats. Strikingly, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of all groups revealed a 100% prevention of acetaminophen-induced mortality of rats by MCRE pretreatment (100 mg/kg/day). MCRE prevented AAH-associated severe weight loss and elicited normal behavior in the rescued rats. Our results suggest that pretreatment with MCRE can mitigate against overdosed acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure and warrant further investigations on the potential of postinjury intervention. Practical applications Acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity (AAH) accounts for alerting numbers of overdose-related acute liver failure and liver transplant cases with increased morbidity and mortality rates. Currently proposed mechanisms implicate mitochondria-mediated oxidative stress and inflammation in the pathogenesis of AAH, which underline current interventions employing antioxidants to combat liver damage by over-dosed acetaminophen. The present work uncovers potent protective effects of some celery extracts (and their fractions) against acetaminophen-induced oxidative stress and inflammation. Treatment of rats with fatal liver injury with methanol extract of celery root significantly reduced secretion of liver enzymes and markedly decreased inflammatory as well as oxidative stress markers in these animals. This, in turn, rescued challenged rats exposed to fatal doses of acetaminophen completely, which establishes methanol extracts of celery roots as effective therapeutic intervention against AAH. The antioxidant capacity of the extracts was determined using EPR technique, and the secondary metabolites related to antioxidant activity were characterized via UPLC-MS.

A comparison of high-throughput plasma NMR protocols for comparative untargeted metabolomics	METABOLOMICS			English	Article						NMR; Metabolomics; High-throughput; Large scale; Classification; LED	BLOOD-PLASMA; H-1-NMR SPECTROSCOPY; METABOLITES; QUANTIFICATION; URINE; SERUM	Introduction When analyzing the human plasma metabolome with Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) experiment is commonly employed for large studies. However, this process can lead to compromised statistical analyses due to residual macromolecule signals. In addition, the utilization of Trimethylsilylpropanoic acid (TSP) as an internal standard often leads to quantification issues, and binning, as a spectral summarization step, can result in features not clearly assignable to metabolites. Objectives Our aim was to establish a new complete protocol for large plasma cohorts collected with the purpose of describing the comparative metabolic profile of groups of samples. Methods We compared the conventional CPMG approach to a novel procedure that involves diffusion NMR, using the Longitudinal Eddy-Current Delay (LED) experiment, maleic acid (MA) as the quantification reference and peak picking for spectral reduction. This comparison was carried out using the ultrafiltration method as a gold standard in a simple sample classification experiment, with Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) and the resulting metabolic signatures for multivariate data analysis. In addition, the quantification capabilities of the method were evaluated. Results We found that the LED method applied was able to detect more metabolites than CPMG and suppress macromolecule signals more efficiently. The complete protocol was able to yield PLS-DA models with enhanced classification accuracy as well as a more reliable set of important features than the conventional CPMG approach. Assessment of the quantitative capabilities of the method resulted in good linearity, recovery and agreement with an established amino acid assay for the majority of the metabolites tested. Regarding repeatability, similar to 85% of all peaks had an adequately low coefficient of variation (< 30%) in replicate samples. Conclusion Overall, our comparison yielded a high-throughput untargeted plasma NMR protocol for optimized data acquisition and processing that is expected to be a valuable contribution in the field of metabolic biomarker discovery.

LC-MS-based metabolomics, followed by multivariate statistical analysis were then applied to comprehensively profile their extracts. The three fungal endophytes revealed interesting antioxidant potential, in particular, the strain isolated from theArtemisia annualeaves (AFL), which was rich in different types of phenolic metabolites. Additionally, all fungal-derived ethyl acetate extracts showed potent inhibition against the prooxidant xanthine oxidase. Multivariate analysis (PCA and PLS-DA) demonstrated a unique chemical fingerprint for each strain, where phenolics, coumarins, and polyketides were the discriminative metabolites of the three fungal strains. The present findings highlighted the power of metabolomics in the chemotaxonomical classification of closely related strains. It also asserted the role of fungal endophytes in the management of oxidative stress, particularly when they are utilized in the production of fermented food products.

The availability of a database containing many comparable NMR spectra produced by different spectrometers is crucial to develop functional classifiers able to discriminate rapidly the commodity class of a given food product. Nevertheless, variability in spectrometer features may hamper the production of comparable spectra due to inherent variations in signal resolution. In this paper, we report on the development of a class-discrimination model for grape juice authentication by application of non-targeted NMR spectroscopy. Different approaches for the pre-treatment of data will be described along with details about the model validation. The developed model performed excellently (95.4-100% correct predictions) even when it was tested against 650 spectra produced by 65 spectrometers with different configurations (magnetic field strength, manufacturer, age). This study may boost the use of non-targeted NMR methods for food control.

They can be activated into M1 and M2 phenotypes when neuroinflammation-related diseases occur. M1 phenotype cells produce pro-inflammatory mediators that cause neuroinflammation and the M2 phenotype can secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines that protect neurons from damage. Therefore, inhibiting the M1 phenotype while stimulating the M2 phenotype has been suggested as a potential therapeutic approach for treating neuroinflammation-related diseases. Puerarin has been demonstrated to exert anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. However, the role of puerarin in regulating microglia polarization and its reaction mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In this paper, a metabolomics approach with ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed to investigate the metabolic changes of BV-2 cells in different phenotypes and test the effects of puerarin on polarization. Thirty-nine metabolites were identified as the biomarkers related to the polarization of BV-2 cells and puerarin intervention reverted the content of most of the biomarkers. Our study demonstrated that puerarin could play a key role in M1/M2 polarization of BV-2 cells from a perspective of metabolomics, and it could regulate the balance between promotion and suppression of inflammation.

Rapid diagnostics is the core of stroke management for early prevention and medical treatment. Serum metabolic fingerprints (SMFs) reflect underlying disease progression, predictive of patient phenotypes. Deep learning (DL) encoding SMFs with clinical indexes outperforms single biomarkers, while posing challenges with poor prediction to interpret by feature selection. Herein, rapid computer-aided diagnosis of stroke is performed using SMF based multi-modal recognition by DL, to combine adaptive machine learning with a novel feature selection approach. SMFs are extracted by nano-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI MS), consuming 100 nL of serum in seconds. A multi-modal recognition is constructed by integrating SMFs and clinical indexes with an enhanced area under curve (AUC) up to 0.845 for stroke screening, compared to single-modal diagnosis by only SMFs or clinical indexes. The prediction of DL is addressed by selecting 20 key metabolite features with differential regulation through a saliency map approach, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms in stroke. The approach highlights the emerging role of DL in precision medicine and suggests an expanding utility for computational analysis of SMFs in stroke screening.

This hypogeous fruit body is known for its aroma. Understanding metabolic variation during ripening can shed light on truffle biology. In this work, the comprehensive polar metabolome and the volatile organic compounds of T. melanosporum were studied at different ripening stages by means of a metabolomic approach using GC-MS. Multivariate statistical data analysis indicated that the metabolic profile changed during ripening and that the metabolites that mostly discriminated truffles in the early ripening stages belonged to the classes of carbohydrates, while free fatty acids and amino acids, among which precursors of VOCs, characterized the late stages of ripening. Principal component analysis of the volatilome indicated that dimethylsulfide and dimethyldisulfide characterized most of the samples collected in December-January, while 1-octen-3-ol samples collected in February-March.

Therefore, we investigated metabolic profiles in HH patients and used ketotic hypoglycemia (KH) patients as a control cohort to unveil their distinct metabolic features. Methods A total of 97 hypoglycemia children, including 74 with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and 23 with ketotic hypoglycemia, and 170 euglycemia control subjects were studied retrospectively. Clinical and biochemical data were collected. The normoglycemic spectra of amino acids and acylcarnitines were determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The serum insulin and fatty acid concentrations during standardized fasting tests in hypoglycemia patients were also collected. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to screen potential biomarkers. Results Among the normoglycemic spectra of amino acids, blood valine (p < 0.001), arginine (p < 0.001), threonine (p = 0.001), glutamate (p = 0.002), methionine (p = 0.005), ornithine (p = 0.008), leucine (p = 0.014), alanine (p = 0.017), proline (p = 0.031), citrulline (p = 0.042), aspartate (p = 0.046), and glycine (p = 0.048) levels differed significantly among the three groups. Significantly decreased levels of long- (C14:1, p < 0.001; C18, p < 0.001), medium- (C8, p < 0.001; C10, p < 0.001; C10:1, p < 0.001), and short-chain (C4-OH, p < 0.001; C5OH, p < 0.001) acylcarnitines were found in the hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia group. Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia children with focal lesions and diffuse lesions had similar amino acid and acylcarnitine spectra. C10:1 < 0.09 mu mol/L, threonine > 35 mu mol/L, and threonine/C10:1 > 440 showed sensitivities of 81.1, 66.2, and 81.1% and specificities of 72.7, 78.3, and 81.8%, respectively, in distinguishing HH from KH. Conclusions We found significantly different altered serum amino acid and acylcarnitine profiles at normoglycemia, especially decreased C10:1 and increased threonine levels, between HH and KH children, which may reflect the insulin ketogenesis inhibition effect in HH patients; however, the detailed mechanisms and physiological roles remain to be studied in the future.

In fact, complete surgical resection remains the only curative treatment. However, fewer than 20% of patients are candidates for surgery at the time of presentation. Hence, there is a critical need to identify diagnostic biomarkers with potential clinical utility in this pathology. In this context, metabolomics could be a powerful tool to search for new robust biomarkers. Comparative metabolomic profiling was performed in serum samples from 59 unresectable PDAC patients and 60 healthy controls. Samples were analyzed by using an untargeted metabolomics workflow based on liquid chromatography, coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry in positive and negative electrospray ionization modes. Univariate and multivariate analysis allowed the identification of potential candidates that were significantly altered in PDAC patients. A panel of nine candidates yielded excellent diagnostic capacities. Pathway analysis revealed four altered pathways in our patients. This study shows the potential of liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry as a diagnostic tool for PDAC. Furthermore, it identified novel robust biomarkers with excellent diagnostic capacities.

Herein, we applied mass spectrometry (MS) (liquid chromatography-MS)-based metabolic and lipid profiling to monitor the effects of the Alum adjuvant on mouse serum at 6, 24, 72, and 168 h post-vaccination. We propose a new strategy termed subclass identification and annotation for metabolomics for class-wise identification of untargeted metabolomics data generated from high-resolution MS. Using this approach, we identified and validated the levels of several lipids in mouse serum that were significantly altered following Alum administration. These lipids showed a biphasic response even 168 h after vaccination. The majority of the lipids were triglycerides (TAGs), where TAGs with long-chain unsaturated fatty acids (FAs) decreased at 24 h and TAGs with short-chain FAs decreased at 168 h. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the impact of human vaccine adjuvant Alum on the host metabolome, which may provide new insights into the mechanism of action of Alum.

Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis and the worldwide incidence is increasing. By revealing the metabolic alterations in serum and urine of gout patients, the first aim of our study was to discover novel molecular biomarkers allowing for early diagnosis. We also aimed to investigate the underlying pathogenic pathways. Methods. Serum and urine samples from gout patients (n = 30) and age-matched healthy controls (n = 30) were analysed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) to screen the differential metabolites and construct a diagnostic model. Next, the model was verified and optimized in the second validation cohort (n = 100). The pathways were illustrated to understand the underlying pathogenesis of gout. Results. In general, serum metabolomics demonstrated a clearer distinction than urine metabolomics. In the discovery cohort, 40 differential serum metabolites were identified that could distinguish gout patients from healthy controls. Among them, eight serum metabolites were verified in the validation cohort. Through regression analysis, the final model consisted of three serum metabolites-pyroglutamic acid, 2-methylbutyryl carnitine and Phe-Phe- that presented optimal diagnostic power. The three proposed metabolites produced an area under the curve of 0.956 (95% CI 0.911, 1.000). Additionally, the proposed metabolic pathways were primarily involved in purine metabolism, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies, bile secretion and arachidonic acid metabolism. Conclusion. The metabolomics signatures could serve as an efficient tool for early diagnosis and provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of gout.

Metabolomic and Metataxonomic Fingerprinting of Human Milk Suggests Compositional Stability over a Natural Term of Breastfeeding to 24 Months	NUTRIENTS			English	Article						human milk; metabolomic fingerprinting; metataxonomics	GUT MICROBIOME; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; MATERNAL DIET; IMPACT; NUTRITION; FAT; CONTAMINATION; CHILDHOOD; EVOLUTION; WEIGHT	Sparse data exist regarding the normal range of composition of maternal milk beyond the first postnatal weeks. This single timepoint, observational study in collaboration with the 'Parenting Science Gang' citizen science group evaluated the metabolite and bacterial composition of human milk from 62 participants (infants aged 3-48 months), nearly 3 years longer than previous studies. We utilised rapid evaporative ionisation mass spectrometry (REIMS) for metabolic fingerprinting and 16S rRNA gene metataxonomics for microbiome composition analysis. Milk expression volumes were significantly lower beyond 24 months of lactation, but there were no corresponding changes in bacterial load, composition, or whole-scale metabolomic fingerprint. Some individual metabolite features (similar to 14%) showed altered abundances in nursling age groups above 24 months. Neither milk expression method nor nursling sex affected metabolite and metataxonomic fingerprints. Self-reported lifestyle factors, including diet and physical traits, had minimal impact on metabolite and metataxonomic fingerprints. Our findings suggest remarkable consistency in human milk composition over natural-term lactation. The results add to previous studies suggesting that milk donation can continue up to 24 months postnatally. Future longitudinal studies will confirm the inter-individual and temporal nature of compositional variations and the use of donor milk as a personalised therapeutic.

However, few systematic identification studies of the bioactive components in vivo have been reported. Herein, the ingredients and metabolites of Gardeniae Fructus were investigated using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-sensitivity Q-TOF mass spectrometry. A total of 45 prototype compounds in Gardeniae Fructus extract were tentatively identified. After oral administration, 69 of prototypes and metabolites were identified from mice bile, plasma, urine, and feces, in which, 31 compounds were prototypes, and 38 chemicals were metabolites. The in vivo biotransformation pathways of these metabolites were also proposed including phase I (hydrolysis, hydrogenation, oxidation, loss of O, and ketone formation, decarboxylation) and phase II reactions (glycine, cysteine, glutathione, and glutamine, and sulfate conjugation, and glucuronidation). For the first time, our results had revealed systematic metabolic profiles of ingredients in Gardeniae Fructus extract in vivo of mice and replenished novel knowledge into the explanation of effective material and/or toxicological basis of Gardeniae Fructus which deserves further investigation.

It is known that cryopreservation induces the loss of fertility-associated proteins, while the effect on metabolites has not been evaluated, although several compounds affect sperm physiology and fertility. The aim of the present work was to study the metabolome in bovine sperm and seminal plasma after cryopreservation and to correlate the metabolic profile of high- and low-fertility bulls in order to identify fertility markers. The analysis, carried out by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry methods, revealed differences in metabolite contents between fresh and cryopreserved semen, both at cellular and plasmatic levels. Interestingly, metabolites showing variation have important functions related to fertility. In addition, the study highlighted the differences in lipid profile between high- and low-fertility bulls. The identification of new potential fertility markers is of high economic impact. In addition, it opens the way for the development of corrective strategies to improve the fertility of low-fertility bulls. Semen cryopreservation determines several sperm damages, including the loss of fertility-associated proteins. The purpose of the study was to compare the metabolite contents in bovine sperm and seminal plasma before and after cryopreservation, and between high- and low-fertility bulls in vitro. Forty-eight ejaculates, collected from eight bulls (six per bull), were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Cryopreservation resulted in an over-expression of lysophosphatidylcholine (0:0/18:2(9Z,12Z)) in seminal plasma. In addition, higher levels of glycine betaine and pyro-l-glutaminyl-l-glutamine were observed in cryopreserved compared to fresh spermatozoa. The fresh seminal plasma of high-fertility bulls showed an over-expression ofl-acetylcarnitine, glycerol tripropanoate, 2,3-diacetoxypropyl stearate and glycerophosphocholine, and an under-expression of lysophosphatidylcholine and butyrylcarnitine, compared to low-fertility bulls. Higher levels of glycerophosphocholine and lysophosphatidylcholine (16:0/0:0) were recorded in fresh spermatozoa from high-fertility bulls. In high-fertility bulls, a greater content of glycerophosphocholine and lower levels of butyrylcarnitine, glycine betaine andl-carnitine were found in cryopreserved seminal plasma, and lower levels of glycine betaine were detected in cryopreserved spermatozoa. In conclusion, cryopreservation affects bovine semen metabolome at both plasmatic and cellular compartments, and metabolic profile differs between high- and low-fertility bulls.

In this study, metabolomics analysis was used to investigate the metabolic profile changes in Monascus aurantiacus Li AS3.4384 (MALA) induced by genistein at different fermentation times using UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. The addition of genistein was found to not only reduce citrinin but also suppress significant differential metabolites. A total of 21 significant differential metabolites were involved in the most significant metabolic pathways (impact >0.1). These metabolites affected the aspartic acid, glutamic acid pathway, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, pyruvate synthesis pathway, and lysine degradation pathway. Thus, the addition of genistein may change the precursor for citrinin synthesis of Monascus. These findings provide significant insight into the Monascus metabolic pathways affected by genistein and will help to improve the quality control and safety of Monascus in food and supplements.

Evaluation of the estrogen biotransformation capacity requires monitoring of various estrogen metabolites. Up to now, only some estrogen metabolites could be measured in urine. However, in order to offer tailor made nutritional support or therapies, a complete estrogen metabolite profile is required in order to identify specific deficiencies in this pathway for each patient individually. Here, we focused on this need to quantify as many as possible of the estrogen-related metabolites excreted in urine. The method was developed to quantify 27 estrogen-related metabolites in small urine quantities. This entailed sample clean-up with a multi-step solid phase extraction procedure, derivatisation of the metabolites in the less water-soluble fraction through dansylation, and analyses using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The metabolites accurately quantified by the method devised included parent estrogens, hydroxylated and methylated forms, metabolites of the 16 alpha-hydroxyestrogen pathway, sulphate and glucuronide conjugated forms, precursors and a related steroid hormone. This method was validated and enabled quantification in the high picograms and low nanograms per millilitre range. Finally, analyses of urine samples confirmed detection and quantification of each of the metabolites.

Metabolic Profiling of gamma-Irradiated Barley Plants Identifies Reallocation of Nitrogen Metabolism and Metabolic Stress Response	DOSE-RESPONSE			English	Article						radiation hormesis; barley; metabolomics; GC-MS; growth stimulation	MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS; HORMESIS; RADIATION; GABA; TOLERANCE; PATHWAYS; ENZYMES	The favorable responses of crop species to low-dose gamma irradiation can help to develop cultivars with increased productivity and improved stress tolerance. In the present study, we tried to reveal the candidate metabolites involved in growth stimulation of barley seedlings after applying low-dose gamma-radiation (Co-60) to seeds. Stimulating doses (5-20 Gy) provided a significant increase in shoot length and biomass, while relatively high dose of 100 Gy led to significant inhibition of growth. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomic analysis uncovered several compounds that may take part in radiation hormesis establishment in irradiated plants. This includes molecules involved in nitrogen redistribution (arginine, glutamine, asparagine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid) and stress-responsive metabolites, such as ascorbate, myo-inositol and its derivates, and free amino acids (l-serine, beta-alanine, pipecolate, and GABA). These results contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of hormesis phenomenon.	[Volkova, Polina Yu.; Makarenko, E. S.; Kazakova, E. A.; Bitarishvili, S. V.; Lychenkova, M.

In this study, we analysed the metabolomic profiles of piglets over this period. Eighteen piglets (nine males and nine females) from three different litters were included in the study. Body weight was recorded at birth (TO), 12 (T1) and 21 (T2) days after birth. Plasma samples were collected at two critical time points of the suckling phase (T1 and T2) and about 180 metabolites of five different biochemical classes (glycerophospholipids, amino acids, biogenic amines, hexoses and acylcarnitines) were analyzed using a target metabolomics approach based on Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Metabolites whose levels could discriminate the plasma profiles at T1 and T2 were identified using the sparse version of Multilevel Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (sMLPLS-DA), coupled with a stability test based on a Leave One Out (LOO) procedure. The level of twenty-three metabolites differed significantly (P < 0.1; both for stability and the effect size) between the two time points. Higher levels of six acylcarnitine (C14:1, C14:1-OH, C16-OH, C4, C5 and C5-OH), serine, threonine and tyrosine, and one phosphatidylcholine (PC ae C42:3) were observed at T1, whereas one biogenic amine (creatinine), eight phosphatidylcholines including PC as C30:2, PC ae C30:0, PC ae C32:1, PC ae C38:4, PC ae C40:4, PC ae C42:4, PC ae C42:5 and PC ae C44:6, and four sphingomyelins, including SM (OH) C22:1, SM C16:0, SM C16:1 and SM C18:0, were more abundant at T2. The Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis and the Pathway Analysis modules suggested a perturbation of the "glycine and serine metabolism" and the "sphingolipid metabolism". Differences of these metabolites between these two time points might be related to the rapid growth and immunological maturation phases of the piglets in this period.

The identified metabolites may be useful markers of the developmental processes occurring in the piglets over this critical pre-weaned phase.

Here, we produced vinegar from peeled and unpeeled roots of bellflowers (Platycodon grandiflorum) usingAcetobacter pasteurianusA11-2 and analyzed bellflower vinegar (BV) samples using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry over 15 days of fermentation to assess the quality. We also evaluated their antibacterial and immunoenhancing effects using RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. The major metabolites in BV are organic acids, with the main volatile compounds being ethyl acetate, isoamyl acetate, 1-pentanol, hydroxypropanoic acid, and malonic acid. When we fermented BV from unpeeled roots for 10 days with a starter culture, we observed significant antibacterial and immunoenhancing effects in macrophages. Therefore, we could determine the metabolite and functional differences in vinegar obtained from bellflower roots and proposed that bellflower roots with peel are an effective substrate for developing vinegar and healthy food products.

The extract is dominated by Delta (9) -tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (A) and its neutral derivative trans -Delta (9) -tetrahydrocannabinol-C (5) (THC) Cis and trans -Delta (9) -tetrahydrocannabinol-C (7) isomers with an ethyl-pentyl branched chain together with minor amounts of trans -Delta (9) -tetrahydrocannabinol with a methyl-pentyl C (6) branched side chain were identified as new natural compounds. Four cannabichromene isomers with a C (5) side chain are postulated to be derived from the double bond migration at the terminal isoprenyl unit. C (7) cannabichromene together with the neutral and acidic forms of cannabinol-C (7) were also detected. The mass spectrum of these homologues as trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives are presented, and the fragmentation patterns are discussed.	[Basas-Jaumandreu, Josep; de las Heras, F.

One bottleneck of its clinical exploitation, however, is the lack of simple and quantitative techniques that enable to capture the key metabolic traits of tumor from archival samples. In fact, liquid chromatography associated with mass spectrometry is the gold-standard technique for the study of tumor metabolism because it has high levels of accuracy and precision. However, it requires freshly frozen samples, which are difficult to collect in large multi-centric clinical studies. For this reason, we propose here to investigate a set of established metabolism-associated protein markers by exploiting immunohistochemistry coupled with digital pathology. As case study, we quantified expression of MCT1, MCT4, GLS, PHGDH, FAS, and ACC in 17 patient-derived ovarian cancer xenografts and correlated it with survival. Among these markers, the glycolysis-associated marker MCT4 was negatively associated with survival of mice. The algorithm enabling a quantitative analysis of these metabolism-associated markers is an innovative research tool that can be exported to large sets of clinical samples and can remove the variability of individual interpretation of immunohistochemistry results.

However, high-throughput and accurate identification of compounds in archaeological samples is challenging. In this work, we propose the use of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) combined with the recently developed chemometric tool autoGCMSDataAnal to identify compounds in archaeological samples. Samples excavated from a tomb of the Xihan dynasty about 2000 BP were used to demonstrate the performance of our proposed methodology. Under the optimized GC-MS instrumental conditions, more than 300 total ion chromatogram peaks were automatically extracted for each sample. Coeluted components were automatically resolved and registered to construct respective mass spectra, based on which compounds were accurately identified. Finally, more than 70 compounds were identified, among which more than 57% were confirmed by standards. A comparison with the automated mass spectral deconvolution and identification system indicates that the combination of GC-MS with autoGCMSDataAnal is suitable for compound identification in archaeological samples.

In this study, bacterial 16S rRNA-gene sequencing, untargeted metabolomics (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) and data integration analyses were used to characterize and differentiate commercial Cheddar cheeses of varying maturity made by the same and different manufacturers. Microbiota and metabolite compositions varied between cheeses of different ages and brands, and could be used to distinguish the cheeses. Individual amino acids and carboxylic acids were positively correlated with the ripening age for some brands. Integration and Random Forest analyses revealed numerous associations between specific bacteria and metabolites including a previously undescribed positive correlation between Thermus and phenylalanine and a negative correlation between Streptococcus and cholesterol. Together these results suggest that multi-omics analyses has the potential to be used for better understanding the relationships between cheese microbiota and metabolites during ripening and for discovering biomarkers for validating cheese age and brand authenticity.

However, limited cell availability is a challenge in metabolic profiling due to the low concentrations affecting the sensitivity. This is further exacerbated by modern technologies such as 3D microfluidic cell culture devices that provide a physiologically realistic environment, compared to traditional techniques such as cell culture in 2D well-plates. Attempts to address sensitivity issues have been made via advances in microscale separation such as CE and micro/nano-LC coupled to mass spectrometers with low-diameter ionization emitter sources. An alternative approach is sample derivatization, which improves the chromatographic separation, enhances the MS ionization, and promotes favourable fragmentation in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Although chemical derivatization is widely used for various applications, few derivatization methods allow sensitive analysis below 1 x 10(4) cells. Here, we conduct RPLC-MS/MS analysis of HepG2 cells ranging from 250 cells to 1 x 10(5) cells, after fast and accessible derivatization by dimethylaminophenacyl bromide (DmPABr), which labels the primary amine, secondary amine, thiol and carboxyl submetabolome, and also utilizes the isotope-coded derivatization (ICD). The analysis of 1 x 10(4) HepG2 cells accomplished quantification of 37 metabolites within 7-minute elution, and included amino acids, N-acetylated amino acids, acylcarntines, fatty acids and TCA cycle metabolites. The metabolic coverage includes commonly studied metabolites involved in the central carbon and energy-related metabolism, showing applicability in various applications and fields. The limit of detection of the method was below 20 nM for most amino acids, and sub 5 nM for the majority of N-acetylated amino acids and acylcarnitines. Good linearity was recorded for derivatized standards in a wide biological range representing expected metabolite levels in 2-10,000 cells. Intraday variability in 5 x 10(3) HepG2 cells was below 20% RSD for concentrations measured of all but two metabolites. The method sensitivity at the highest dilution of cell extract, 250 HepG2 cells, enabled the quantification of twelve metabolites and the detection of three additional metabolites below LLOQ. Where possible, performance parameters were compared to published methodologies that measure cell extract samples. The presented work shows a proof of concept for harnessing a derivatization method for sensitive analysis of material-limited biological samples. It offers an attractive tool with further potential for enhanced performance when coupled to low-material suitable technologies such as CE-MS and micro/nano LC-MS.	[Willacey, Cornelius C.

Coptis deltoidea is an important medicinal plant with a long history of medicinal use, which is rich in benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs). In this study, Ultra performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS) and combined sequencing platforms were performed for exploration of BIAs biosynthesis, accumulation and comprehensive transcriptome analysis of C. deltoidea. By metabolism profiling, the accumulation of ten BIAs was analyzed using UHPLC-MS/MS and different contents were observed in different organs. From transcriptome sequencing result, we applied single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing to C. deltoidea and generated a total of 75,438 full-length transcripts. We proposed the candidate biosynthetic pathway of tyrosine, precursor of BIAs, and identified 64 full length-transcripts encoding enzymes putatively involved in BIAs biosynthesis. RNA-Seq data indicated that the majority of genes exhibited relatively high expression level in roots. Transport of BIAs was also important for their accumulation. Here, 9 ABC transporters and 2 MATE transporters highly homologous to known alkaloid transporters related with BIAs transport in roots and rhizomes were identified. These findings based on the combined sequencing platforms provide valuable genetic information for C. deltoidea and the results of transcriptome combined with metabolome analysis can help us better understand BIAs biosynthesis and transport in this medicinal plant. The information will be critical for further characterization of C. deltoidea transcriptome and molecular-assisted breeding for this medicinal plant with scarce resources.

Evidence suggests that chronic or repeated ketamine use could induce neurological and psychological harm, while the mechanisms underlying ketamine's effects on the nervous system are still unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the metabolic changes that occur in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus (Hip) and striatum of rats with repeated ketamine exposure and withdrawal intervention and to identify the potential metabolic pathways influenced by ketamine. An untargeted ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS)-based metabolomics method coupled with multivariate and univariate statistical analysis was applied to analyze the metabolic profiles of the PFC, Hip, and striatum and to identify metabolite alterations. The pathway analysis tool in Metabo-Analyst was subsequently applied for pathway predictions. A total of 79, 54 and 58 changed metabolites were identified in the PFC, Hip and striatum, respectively, after repeated ketamine exposure. Pathway analysis indicated that purine metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism were the main pathways disturbed by ketamine in all three brain regions. After one week of withdrawal intervention, most changed metabolites in the Hip and striatum had been restored to control levels, while the metabolite alterations in the PFC were persistent. These results revealed that repeated ketamine exposure significantly changed purine metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism in the PFC, Hip and striatum, which might be involved in the neurotoxic effects of ketamine. Additionally, this study also identified that the PFC, rather than the Hip or striatum, was more likely to be the target region of the long-term effects of ketamine. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to investigate the metabolomic changes in A. johnsonii, P. fluorescens, and their co-culture by screening for metabolic markers. PCA and PLS-DA revealed that A, P, and AP groups were different from each other, indicating a significantly varying metabolic profile among them. Based on UHPLC information, 540 metabolites with significant differences, were identified in the ESI+ and ESI- modes, which covered 79 metabolic pathways. The different metabolites were mainly related to the pathways, such as taurine and hypotaurine metabolism:M, bile secretion:OS, and arginine biosynthesis:M were in the A vs AP group, while PPAR signaling pathway:OS, tropane, piperidine, and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis:M, longevity regulating pathway-worm:OS, choline metabolism in cancer:HD, biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids:M, and amoebiasis:HD were in the P vs AP group. Therefore, this study may provide significant information regarding the metabolic mechanisms of A. johnsonii, P. fluorescens, and their co-cultures, which may provide insights on their role in deteriorating the quality of aquatic products.

The LC-QTOF/MS data were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squared discrimination analysis (OPLS-DA) to find the potential characteristic components of C. camphora leaves from the four areas in a quick way. C. camphora leaves from different areas could be separated into four different groups chemically according to the PCA scores. The chemical constituents in C. camphora leaves from four areas were obviously different. The potential markers were identified by comparison with the reference compounds or were tentatively assigned by matching the retention time, empirical molecular formula and fragment ions with those of the published compounds of C. camphora leaves. The proposed analytical method is fast, accurate and reliable for differentiating C. camphora leaves from different areas. Moreover, this study supplied a new method for the quality evaluation of other medicinal materials.

Given its rich biodiversity, soil is also a major source for natural product drug discovery from soil microorganisms. However, the study of the soil small molecule profile has been challenging due to the complexity and heterogeneity of this matrix. In this study, we implemented high-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and large-scale data analysis tools such as molecular networking to characterize the relative contributions of city, state and regional processes on backyard soil metabolite composition, in 188 soil samples collected from 14 USA States, representing five USA climate regions. We observed that region, state and city of collection all influence the overall soil metabolite profile. However, many metabolites were only detected in unique sites, indicating that uniquely local phenomena also influence the backyard soil environment, with both human-derived and naturally-produced (plant-derived, microbially-derived) metabolites identified. Overall, these findings are helping to define the processes that shape the backyard soil metabolite composition, while also highlighting the need for expanded metabolomic studies of this complex environment.

We hypothesized that clinical outcomes of newborns with (HIE) can be associated with changes at plasma metabolic level enabling the detection of brain injury. Plasma samples of a cohort of 55 asphyxiated infants who evolved to moderate/severe HIE were collected between birth and completion of therapeutic hypothermia (TH). Samples were analyzed employing a quantitative gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method for the determination of lactate and pyruvate and an untargeted liquid chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry method for metabolic fingerprinting. Brain injury was assessed employing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A critical assessment of the usefulness of lactate, pyruvate, and pyruvate/lactate for outcome prediction was carried out. Besides, metabolic fingerprinting identified a dynamic perturbation of eleven metabolic pathways, including amino acid and purine metabolism, and the steroid hormone biosynthesis, in newborns with pathologic MRI outcomes. Although data suggest the usefulness of lactate and pyruvate monitoring during 72 h for discerning outcomes, only the steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway was significantly altered in early plasma samples (i.e., before the initiation of TH). This study highlights pathways that might potentially be targeted for biomarker discovery or adjuvant therapies to be combined with TH.

Gaertn., Asteraceae) accumulate high amounts of silymarin (SILM), a complex mixture of bioactive flavonolignans deriving from taxifolin. Their biological activities in relation with human health promotion and disease prevention are well described. However, the conditions of their biosynthesis in planta are still obscure. To fill this gap, fruit development stages were first precisely defined to study the accumulation kinetics of SILM constituents during fruit ripening. The accumulation profiles of the SILM components during fruit maturation were determined using the LC-MS analysis of these defined developmental phases. The kinetics of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), chalcone synthase (CHS) and peroxidase (POX) activities suggest in situ biosynthesis of SILM froml-Phenylalanine during fruit maturation rather than a transport of precursors to the achene. In particular, in contrast to laccase activity, POX activity was associated with the accumulation of silymarin, thus indicating a possible preferential involvement of peroxidase(s) in the oxidative coupling step leading to flavonolignans. Reference genes have been identified, selected and validated to allow accurate gene expression profiling of candidate biosynthetic genes (PAL,CAD,CHS,F3H,F3'HandPOX) related to SILM accumulation. Gene expression profiles were correlated with SILM accumulation kinetic and preferential location in pericarp duringS. marianumfruit maturation, reaching maximum biosynthesis when desiccation occurs, thus reinforcing the hypothesis of an in situ biosynthesis. This observation led us to consider the involvement of abscisic acid (ABA), a key phytohormone in the control of fruit ripening process. ABA accumulation timing and location during milk thistle fruit ripening appeared in line with a potential regulation of the SLIM accumulation. A possible transcriptional regulation of SILM biosynthesis by ABA was supported by the presence of ABA-responsive cis-acting elements in the promoter regions of the SILM biosynthetic genes studied. These results pave the way for a better understanding of the biosynthetic regulation of SILM during the maturation ofS. marianumfruit and offer important insights to better control the production of these medicinally important compounds.

In general, the seeds contain high nutrients, but rambutan seeds are thrown out during processing. In this study, the anti-aging activity of rambutan seeds was evaluated with a new approach through the selective inhibition of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (senomorphics). Luciferase promoter assays using p16INK4A and SA-beta-gal promoters for rambutan showed that its seeds possessed strong senomorphic activity. Molecular networking using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-qTOF-MS) with a tandem database (UPLC-qTOF-MS/MS) was applied to determine the chemical composition of rambutan. Based on the activity results, nine compounds, one new (7) and eight known kaempferol type compounds, were isolated from the seeds. Compounds2,4and9significantly reduced the mRNA expression levels of senescence markers, such as p16INK4A, p21CIP1, p53 and SA-beta-gal. These compounds also significantly increased the level of SIRT1, a longevity modulator. Compounds2,4and9decreased the mRNA expression levels of senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASPs) and subsequently decreased the number of SA-beta-gal-positive cells. Thus, rambutan seeds and its constituents might be able to protect against age-related problems.

Biological potential was evaluated by determining antioxidant (DPPH, FRAP, and Phosphomolybdenum) and enzyme inhibitory (butrylcholinesterase and lipoxygenase) effects. Higher total bioactive contents were found in methanolic extracts which tend to correlate with higher radical scavenging and reducing potential of these extracts. LC/MS spectrum revealed the presence of 16 different secondary metabolites belonging to terpene, glucoside and sesquiterpenoid dervivatives. Glucocleomin and emotin A were the main compounds present in all three parts. The strongest butrylcholinesterase and lipoxygenase inhibitory activity was observed for root and stem DCM extracts. Demonstrated biological potential of S. oleoides plant can trace a new road map for developing newly designed bioactive pharmaceuticals.

In the present work, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics was employed to monitor the hydrophilic metabolites of sea bream during storage on ice for 19 days. Additionally, the quality changes were evaluated using two conventional methods: sensory evaluation according to European Union's grading scheme and K-value, the most widely used chemical index of fish spoilage. With the application of chemometrics, the fish samples were successfully classified in the freshness categories, and a partial least squares regression model was built to predict K-value. A list of differential metabolites were found, which were distinguished according to their evolution profile as potential biomarkers of freshness and spoilage.

Exposure to parabens has been found to be associated with metabolic alterations of human and an increased risk of metabolic disease, such as diabetes. However, limited information is available about metabolic pathways related to paraben exposure. In this study, three parabens were determined in the urine samples of 88 pregnant women by using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QqQ MS). The samples were divided into different groups based on tertile distribution of urinary paraben concentrations. Metabolic profiling of the 88 urine samples was performed by using UHPLC coupled with Orbitrap high-resolution MS. Differential metabolites were screened by comparing the profiles of urine samples from different paraben-exposure groups. The identified metabolites included purines, acylcarnitines, etc., revealing that metabolic pathways such as purine metabolism, fatty acid beta-oxidation, and other pathways were disturbed by parabens. Eighteen and three metabolites were correlated (Spearman correlation analysis, p < 0.05) with the exposure levels of methyparaben and propylparaben, respectively. This is the first MS-based nontargeted metabolomics study on pregnant women with paraben exposure. The findings reveal the potential health risk of exposure to parabens and might help one to understand the link between paraben exposure and some metabolic diseases.

Comparative metabolomic responses of low- and high-cadmium accumulating genotypes reveal the cadmium adaptive mechanism in Brassica napus	CHEMOSPHERE			English	Article						Oilseed rape; Cadmium toxicity; Genotypic variation; Metabolomics; Differential metabolites	ABIOTIC STRESS TOLERANCE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; ULTRASTRUCTURAL-CHANGES; TOXICITY; PLANTS; LEAVES; L.; BIOSYNTHESIS; MOLYBDENUM; EXPRESSION	Recently, oilseed rape has gathered interest for its ability to withstand elevated metal contents in plant, a key feature for remediation of contaminated soils. In this study, comparative and functional metabolomic analyses using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry were undertaken to explore the metabolic basis of this attribute under cadmium (Cd) stress. Results revealed both conserved and differential metabolomic responses between genotype CB671 (tolerant Cd-accumulating) and its sensitive counterpart ZD622. CB671 responded to Cd stress by rearranging carbon flux towards production of compatible solutes, sugar storage forms and ascorbate, as well as jasmonates, ethylene and vitamin B6. Intriguingly, IAA abundance was reduced by 1.91-fold, which was in connection with tryptophan funnelling into serotonin (3.48-fold rise). In ZD622 by contrast, Cd provoked drastic depletion of carbohydrates and vitamins, but subtle hormones alteration. A striking accumulation of unsaturated fatty acids and oxylipins in CB671, paralleled by glycerophospholipids build-up and induction of inositolderived signalling metabolites (up to 5.41-fold) suggested ability for prompt triggering of detoxifying mechanisms. Concomitantly, phytosteroids, monoterpenes and carotenoids were induced, denoting fine-tuned mechanisms for membrane maintenance, which was not evident in ZD622. Further, ZD622 markedly accumulated phenolics from upstream sub-classes of flavonoids; in CB671 however, a distinct phenolic wiring was activated, prioritizing anthocyanins and lignans instead. Along with cell wall (CW) saccharides, the activation of lignans evoked CW priming in CB671. Current results have demonstrated existence of notable metabolomic-based strategies for Cd tolerance in metal-accumulating oilseed rapes, and provided a holistic view of metabolites potentially contributing to Cd tolerance in this species.

They exhibit a higher burden in terms of both mortality and morbidity in comparison to patients with only asthma or COPD. The pathophysiology of the disease and its existence as a unique disease entity remains unclear. The present study aims to determine whether ACO has a distinct metabolic and immunological mediator profile in comparison to asthma and COPD. Methods Global metabolomic profiling using two different groups of patients [discovery (D) and validation (V)] were conducted. Serum samples obtained from moderate and severe asthma [n = 34(D); n = 32(V)], moderate and severe COPD [n = 30(D); 32(V)], ACO patients [n = 35(D); 40(V)] and healthy controls [n = 33(D)] were characterized using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Multiplexed analysis of 25 immunological markers (IFN-gamma (interferon gamma), TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor alpha), IL-12p70 (interleukin 12p70), IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-10, IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, TGF-beta (transforming growth factor), IL-6, IL-17E, IL-21, IL-23, eotaxin, GM-CSF (granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor), IFN-alpha (interferon alpha), IL-18, NGAL (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin), periostin, TSLP (thymic stromal lymphopoietin), MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1), YKL-40 (chitinase 3 like 1) and IL-8) was also performed in the discovery cohort. Results Eleven metabolites [serine, threonine, ethanolamine, glucose, cholesterol, 2-palmitoylglycerol, stearic acid, lactic acid, linoleic acid, D-mannose and succinic acid] were found to be significantly altered in ACO as compared with asthma and COPD. The levels and expression trends were successfully validated in a fresh cohort of subjects. Thirteen immunological mediators including TNF alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-17E, GM-CSF, IL-18, NGAL, IL-5, IL-10, MCP-1, YKL-40, IFN-gamma, IL-6 and TGF-beta showed distinct expression patterns in ACO. These markers and metabolites exhibited significant correlation with each other and also with lung function parameters. Conclusions The energy metabolites, cholesterol and fatty acids correlated significantly with the immunological mediators, suggesting existence of a possible link between the inflammatory status of these patients and impaired metabolism. The present findings could be possibly extended to better define the ACO diagnostic criteria, management and tailoring therapies exclusively for the disease.

ESSENTIAL OIL; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS; CYTOTOXIC ACTIVITY; WILD POPULATIONS; L.; VARIABILITY; ANTIBACTERIAL; SPECTROSCOPY	Geographic location and connected environmental and edaphic factors like temperature, rainfall, soil type, and composition influence the presence and the total content of specific plant compounds as well as the presence of a certain chemotype. This study evaluated whether geographic, edaphic, and climatic information can be utilized to predict the presence of specific compounds from medicinal or aromatic plants. Furthermore, we tested rapid analytical methods based on near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) coupled with gas chromatography/flame ionization (GC/FID) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analytical methods for characterization and classification metabolite profiling ofZataria multifloraBoiss. populations.Z. multiflorais an aromatic, perennial plant with interesting pharmacological and biological properties. It is widely dispersed in Iran as well as in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Here, we studied the effect of environmental factors on essential oil (EO) content and the composition and distribution of chemotypes. Our results indicate that this species grows predominantly in areas rich in calcium, iron, potassium, and aluminum, with mean rainfall of 40.46 to 302.72 mm center dot year(-1)and mean annual temperature of 14.90 degrees C to 28.80 degrees C. EO content ranged from 2.75% to 5.89%. Carvacrol (10.56-73.31%), thymol (3.51-48.12%), linalool (0.90-55.38%), andp-cymene (1.66-13.96%) were the major constituents, which classified 14 populations into three chemotypes. Corresponding to the phytochemical cluster analysis, the hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) based on NIR data also recognized the carvacrol, thymol, and linalool chemotypes. Hence, NIR has the potential to be applied as a useful tool to determine rapidly the chemotypes ofZ. multifloraand similar herbs. EO and EO constituent content correlated with different geographic location, climate, and edaphic factors. The structural equation models (SEMs) approach revealed direct effects of soil factors (texture, phosphor, pH) and mostly indirect effects of latitude and altitude directly affecting, e.g., soil factors. Our approach of identifying environmental predictors for EO content, chemotype or presence of high amounts of specific compounds can help to select regions for sampling plant material with the desired chemical profile for direct use or for breeding.

The cultivar Ningqi1, widely grown in Northwest China was collected from three typical ecological growing counties with contrasting climatic conditions: Ningxia Zhongning (NF), Xinjiang Jinghe (XF) and Qinghai Nomuhong (QF). During the ripening period, 45 fruits from different plantations at each location were sampled. A total of 393 metabolites were detected in all samples through the widely targeted metabolomics approach and grouped into 19 known classes. Fruits from QF were the biggest followed by those from XF and NF. The altitude, relative humidity and light intensity had negative and strong correlations with most of the metabolites, suggesting that growing wolfberry in very high altitudes and under high light intensity is detrimental for the fruit nutritional quality. Soil moisture content is highly and negatively correlated with vitamins, organic acids and carbohydrates while moderately and positively correlated with other classes of metabolites. In contrast, air and soil temperatures exhibited positive correlation with majority of the metabolites. Overall, our results suggest high soil and air temperatures, low altitude and light intensity and moderate soil moisture, as the suitable conditions to produce Lycium fruits with high content of nutritious metabolites.

However, there is still ongoing monitoring and reporting of positive findings of these banned substances in EU countries. The aim of this work was to investigate the efficacy and discriminatory ability of metabolic fingerprinting after the administration of 17 beta-testosterone esters to pigs. Plasma and urine samples were chromatographically separated on a Hypersil Gold C18 column. High resolution mass spectrometry metabolomic fingerprints were analysed on a hybrid mass spectrometer Q-Exactive. Three independent multivariate statistical methods, namely principal component analysis, clustre analysis, and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis showed significant differences between the treated and control groups of pigs even 14 days after the administration of the hormonal drug. Plasma samples were also analysed by a conventional quantitative analysis using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry and a pharmacokinetic curve was constructed based on the results. In this case, no testosterone residue was detected 14 days after the administration. The results clearly showed that a metabolomics approach can be a useful and effective tool for the detection and monitoring of banned anabolic steroids used illegally in pig fattening.

This is a retrospective study based on two independent cohorts: a Dutch cohort, which comprises 20 ADdem, 20 MCI-AD, and 20 non-AD patients, and an Italian cohort, constituted by 14 ADdem and 12 non-AD patients. H-1 NMR CSF spectra were analyzed using OPLS-DA. Metabolomic fingerprinting in the Dutch cohort provides a significant discrimination (86.1% accuracy) between ADdem and non-AD. MCI-AD patients show a good discrimination with respect to ADdem (70.0% accuracy) but only slight differences when compared with non-AD (59.6% accuracy). Acetate, valine, and 3-hydroxyisovalerate result to be altered in ADdem patients. Valine correlates with cognitive decline at follow-up (R = 0.53, P = 0.0011). The discrimination between ADdem and non-AD was confirmed in the Italian cohort. The CSF metabolomic fingerprinting shows a signature characteristic of ADdem patients with respect to MCI-AD and non-AD patients.

Compared to patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD, those requiring haemodialysis (HD) have increased morbidity and mortality. We wished to characterise metabolic patterns in CKD compared to HD patients using metabolomics. Prevalent non-HD CKD KDIGO stage 3b-4 and stage 5 HD outpatients were screened at a single tertiary hospital. Various liquid chromatography approaches hyphenated with mass spectrometry were used to identify 278 metabolites. Unsupervised and supervised data analyses were conducted to characterize metabolic patterns. 69 patients were included in the CKD group and 35 in the HD group. Unsupervised data analysis showed clear clustering of CKD, pre-dialysis (preHD) and post-dialysis (postHD) patients. Supervised data analysis revealed qualitative as well as quantitative differences in individual metabolites profiles between CKD, preHD and postHD states. An original metabolomics framework could discriminate between CKD stages and highlight HD effect based on 278 identified metabolites. Significant differences in metabolic patterns between CKD and HD patients were found overall as well as for specific metabolites. Those findings could explain clinical discrepancies between patients requiring HD and those with earlier stage of CKD.

Previous research on UC has focused on serum, plasma, urine, gut tissues, and fecal metabolic profiling, but a comprehensive investigation into the correlation between the severity of colitis and changes in liver metabolism is still lacking. Since the liver and gut exchange nutrients and metabolites through a complex network, intestinal diseases can affect both the liver and other organs. In the present study, concentration-dependent dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis was employed to examine changes in liver metabolism using a proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-NMR)-and ultra-performance liquid chromatography time of flight mass spectroscopy (UPLC-TOF MS)-based metabolomics study. Using the multivariate statistical analysis method orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), changes in metabolites depending on the DSS dose could be clearly distinguished. Specifically, hepatic metabolites involved in one-carbon metabolism, carnitine-related metabolism, and nucleotide synthesis were found to be affected by intestinal inflammation, implying the existence of a metabolic connection between the gut and liver. We are currently investigating the significance of this metabolic condition in UC.

AGF was collected by an artificial vagina from five vasectomized rams. Metabolites were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS), with the support of Human Metabolome Database, PubChem, LIPID Metabolites, Pathways Strategy databases, and MetaboAnalyst platforms. There were 182 and 190 metabolites detected by GC/MS and LC/MS, respectively, with an overlap of one molecule. Lipids and lipid-like molecules were the most abundant class of metabolites in the ram AGF (127 compounds), followed by amino acids, peptides, and analogs(103 metabolites). Considering all GC/MS and LC/MS, fructose, glycerol, citric acid, d-mannitol, d-glucose, and l-(+)-lactic acid were the most abundant single metabolites present in the ram AGF. Meaningful pathways associated with AGF metabolites included glycine, serine and threonine metabolism; pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis; galactose metabolism; glutamate metabolism and phenylalanine metabolism, and so forth. In conclusion, the combined use of LC/MS and GC/MS was essential for getting a holistic view of the compounds embedded in the ram AGF. Chemical analysis of the accessory sex gland secretion is relevant for understanding sperm function and fertilization.

Gene expression studies have highlighted the presence of substantial changes occurring at the onset of sexual reproduction. Herein, we have hypothesized that the amount and nature of cellular metabolites varies along the mating process. To capture the metabolome ofPseudo-nitzschia multistriataat different harvesting times in an unbiased manner, we undertook an untargeted metabolomics approach based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Using three different extraction steps, the method revealed pronounced differences in the metabolic profiles between control cells in the vegetative phase (MT+ and MT-) and mixed strains of opposite MTs (cross) undergoing sexual reproduction. Of the 2408 high-quality features obtained, 70 known metabolites could be identified based on in-house libraries and online databases; additional 46 features could be classified by molecular networking of tandem mass spectra. The reduction of phytol detected in the cross can be linked to the general downregulation of photosynthesis during sexual reproduction observed elsewhere. Moreover, the role of highly regulated compounds such as 7-dehydrodesmosterol, whose changes in abundance were the highest in the experiment, oleamide, ectoine, or trigonelline is discussed.

Transient global cerebral ischemia (tGCI) leads to selective neuronal cell death in the CA1 sub-region of the hippocampus, while the neighboring CA3 sub-region is left largely intact. By studying factors pertaining to such selective vulnerability, we can develop therapies to enhance outcome after stroke. Using untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we analyzed temporal metabolomic changes in CA1 and CA3 hippocampal areas following tGCI in rats till the setting of neuronal apoptosis. 64 compounds in CA1 and 74 in CA3 were found to be enriched and statistically significant following tGCI. Pathway analysis showed that pyrimidine and purine metabolism pathways amongst several others to be enriched after tGCI in CA1 and CA3. Metabolomics analysis was able to capture very early changes following ischemia. We detected 6 metabolites to be upregulated and 6 to be downregulated 1hour after tGCI in CA1 versus CA3. Several metabolites related to apoptosis and inflammation were differentially expressed in both regions after tGCI. We offer a new insight into the process of neuronal apoptosis, guided by metabolomic profiling that was not performed to such an extent previously.

Integration of genomics, metagenomics, and metabolomics to identify interplay between susceptibility alleles and microbiota in adenoma initiation	BMC CANCER			English	Article						Genetics; Gut microbiota; Colorectal cancer; Metabolomics; Apc; Min	BILE-ACID; HYDROGEN-SULFIDE; COLORECTAL-CANCER; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; MOUSE; DNA; GENES; LOCUS; RISK; MICE	BackgroundColorectal cancer (CRC) is a multifactorial disease resulting from both genetic predisposition and environmental factors including the gut microbiota (GM), but deciphering the influence of genetic variants, environmental variables, and interactions with the GM is exceedingly difficult. We previously observed significant differences in intestinal adenoma multiplicity between C57BL/6J-Apc(Min) (B6-Min/J) from The Jackson Laboratory (JAX), and original founder strain C57BL/6JD-Apc(Min) (B6-Min/D) from the University of Wisconsin.MethodsTo resolve genetic and environmental interactions and determine their contributions we utilized two genetically inbred, independently isolated Apc(Min) mouse colonies that have been separated for over 20 generations. Whole genome sequencing was used to identify genetic variants unique to the two substrains. To determine the influence of genetic variants and the impact of differences in the GM on phenotypic variability, we used complex microbiota targeted rederivation to generate two Apc mutant mouse colonies harboring complex GMs from two different sources (GMJAX originally from JAX or GMHSD originally from Envigo), creating four Apc(Min) groups. Untargeted metabolomics were used to characterize shifts in the fecal metabolite profile based on genetic variation and differences in the GM.ResultsWGS revealed several thousand high quality variants unique to the two substrains. No homozygous variants were present in coding regions, with the vast majority of variants residing in noncoding regions. Host genetic divergence between Min/J and Min/D and the complex GM additively determined differential adenoma susceptibility. Untargeted metabolomics revealed that both genetic lineage and the GM collectively determined the fecal metabolite profile, and that each differentially regulates bile acid (BA) metabolism. Metabolomics pathway analysis facilitated identification of a functionally relevant private noncoding variant associated with the bile acid transporter Fatty acid binding protein 6 (Fabp6). Expression studies demonstrated differential expression of Fabp6 between Min/J and Min/D, and the variant correlates with adenoma multiplicity in backcrossed mice.ConclusionsWe found that both genetic variation and differences in microbiota influences the quantitiative adenoma phenotype in Apc(Min) mice. These findings demonstrate how the use of metabolomics datasets can aid as a functional genomic tool, and furthermore illustrate the power of a multi-omics approach to dissect complex disease susceptibility of noncoding variants.

Reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) have been used to the analysis of nonpolar metabolites and polar metabolites, respectively. In this work, an alternate HILIC/RPLC-mass spectrometry (MS) approach was developed for the comprehensive and high-throughput analysis of polar and nonpolar metabolites. HILIC and RPLC are respectively performed on two ultra-high performance LC (UHPLC) systems, and coupled to one mass spectrometer to acquire the data. When HILIC gradient elution is running RPLC is in a washing and equilibration state, and vice versa. As a result, the total analysis time was reduced by about one third to 25.4 min. Two hundred and eight representative standards including at least twelve types of commonly met metabolites, SRM 1950 plasma, serum, urine and liver tissue samples were used to test the established alternate HILIC/RPLC-MS method. The results demonstrated that the method possessed high metabolite coverage. The developed method was validated to have good linearity and repeatability. As an example of application, 61 significantly changed metabolites in the colon cancer tissues were defined by this established method.

A total of 47 patients with stage III (T4b) or IV gastric cancer, including 31 in the training group and 16 in a validation group, were classified based on their responses to conversion therapy consisting of oxaliplatin, tegafur and continuous hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion with cisplatin. Serum samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to obtain a metabolite profile of each patient. Patients who were responsive and non-responsive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy exhibited significant differences in serum levels of deoxyribose 1-phosphate, S-lactoylglutathione, lysophosphatidylcholine (16:0) and O-arachidonoyl ethanolamine. Logistic regression analysis indicated that deoxyribose 1-phosphate and S-lactoylglutathione were independently associated with chemosensitivity. Serum levels of deoxyribose 1-phosphate and S-lactoylglutathione were independently associated with the sensitivity of gastric cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, therefore, serving as potential predictors of patient response.

Research indicates that the prevalence and presentation of TNBC varies among races, with Asian TNBC patients more commonly presenting with large invasive tumors, high node positivity, and high histologic grade. In this work, we applied ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS)-based metabolomics to discover metabolic signatures in Asian female TNBC patients. Serum samples from 31 TNBC patients and 31 healthy controls (CN) were involved in this study. A total of 2860 metabolic features were detected in the serum samples. Among them, 77 metabolites, whose levels were significantly different between TNBC with CN, were confirmed. Using multivariate statistical analysis, literature mining, metabolic network and pathway analysis, we performed an in-depth study of the metabolic alterations in the Asian TNBC population. In addition, we discovered a panel of metabolic signatures that are highly correlated with the 5-year survival rate of the TNBC patients. This metabolomic study provides a better understanding of the metabolic details of TNBC in the Asian population.

Metabolomic Diversity and Identification of Antibacterial Activities of Bacteria Isolated From Marine Sediments in Hawai'i and Puerto Rico	FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR BIOSCIENCES			English	Article						marine sediments; secondary metabolites; Actinobacteria; Streptomyces; Bacillus	NATURAL-PRODUCTS; TRONDHEIM FJORD; ACTINOBACTERIA; DISCOVERY; ANTIBIOTICS; PHYLOGENIES; NORWAY	Antibiotic resistance is a growing concern worldwide and consequently metabolomic tools are being applied increasingly in efforts aimed at identifying new antimicrobial compounds. Marine bacteria-derived compounds have shown great promise in this area. A metabolomics-based study was undertaken to study the diversity of secondary metabolites from marine sediment bacteria isolated from different locations of Hawai'i and Puerto Rico. This effort included characterizing the biodiversity in the sediment samples and searching for antibacterial activity and associated compounds. Bacterial strains were isolated using several different nutrient agars and culture conditions. DNA sequencing (16s rDNA) was used for phylogenetic characterization. Antibacterial activity was assessed against antibiotic-resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Ethyl acetate extracted bacterial secondary metabolites were measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, processed in Progenesis QI and further analyzed by partial least squares-discriminant analysis using MetaboAnalyst 3. Among the strains (n = 143) that were isolated from these two geographical areas and tested for antibiotic activity, 19 exhibited antibacterial activity against at least one antibiotic-resistant human pathogen. One strain from Hawai'i possessed broad-spectrum activity against all five pathogens. Metabolite profiles were diverse and separated the strains into two clusters in PCA analysis that mirrored geographical origin of the isolated strains. A diversity of bacteria and potential antibacterial compounds were observed in this study. Marine environments represent an opportunity to discover a rich diversity of antibacterial compounds for which resistance mechanisms may be uncommon in human pathogens.

However, the flavor-producing core bacteria closely related to each phase are still poorly understood. The phase characteristics of Sichuan bran vinegar fermentation were investigated in this study. The dynamic changes of physicochemical factors, flavor substances, and bacterial communities in the fermentation process of Sichuan bran vinegar were analyzed. Via a partial least squares regression analysis (PLSR) model and network analysis, the phases of solid-state fermentation were defined, and the core species and corresponding flavor compounds closely related to each fermentation phase were noted. To find the physicochemical factors that have a large influence on the growth of core bacteria at each phase, the phased effects of different factors on the key flavor compounds and bacteria were analyzed. The results showed that temperature was the main influencing factor, promoting the metabolism profile of nonvolatile flavor-producing bacteria in the fourth phase, such asPseudomonasandHelicobacter.This study provides theoretical support for the establishment of a controllable fermentation system.

In this work, crabs (Portunus trituberculatus) were sampled from four sites, namely a reference (site 3934) and three metal-polluted (sites 6151, 6351, and 3562) sites, located in the Bohai Sea. Metal concentrations in crab gill tissues were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Cu, Zn, and Cd in crab samples from S3562 presented the highest concentrations. Particularly, Cu concentration exceeded the marine biological quality standard II. Cd contents in crab samples from all metal-polluted sites exceeded the marine biological quality standard I. Nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics indicated metal pollution-induced immune stresses in crab samples from all metal-polluted sites. Metal pollution in S6151 and S6351 disturbed energy metabolism through differential pathways. For crab samples from S3562, the metabolic profile suggested that metal pollution mainly induced osmotic stress.

Recently, the fungal co-cultivation has emerged as a promising method to discover novel antimicrobial metabolites. In this study, an established technique of co-culturing Scytalidium parasiticum and Ganoderma boninense was applied to produce and induce metabolites that have antifungal activity against G. boninense. The crude extract from the co-culture media was applied to a High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) preparative column to isolate the bioactive compounds, which were tested against G. boninense. The fractions that showed inhibition against G. boninense were sent for a Liquid Chromatography-Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometry (LC-TOF-MS) analysis to further identify the compounds that were responsible for the microbicidal activity. Interestingly, we found that eudistomin I, naringenin 7-O-beta-D-glucoside and penipanoid A, which were present in different abundances in all the active fractions, except in the control, could be the antimicrobial metabolites. In addition, the abundance of fatty acids, such as oleic acid and stearamide in the active fraction, also enhanced the antimicrobial activity. This comprehensive metabolomics study could be used as the basis for isolating biocontrol compounds to be applied in oil palm fields to combat a Ganoderma infection.

A proportion of NAFLD patients develop hepatic inflammation, known as Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), which can end up in cirrhosis, or Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). In this scenario, partial hepatectomy (PH) is an alternative to promote liver regeneration. However, as liver regeneration is impaired in NASH patients, more knowledge about its metabolic condition is needed to improve the regenerative response of the liver in this pathological condition. Although extensively employed, the panoply of molecular alterations involved in the regenerative response of the liver after partial hepatectomy PH is far from being fully characterized. Metabolic fingerprinting (metabolomics) is a powerful tool to help in the elucidation of complex metabolic networks, by means of a blind, naive approach to study which metabolic nodes (metabolites) show the biggest variations between conditions. The objective of the present study was to gain deeper knowledge about the metabolic processes involved in the NASH animal model, and particularly in the effect of PH by using metabolomics. For achieving such information, twelve 8-week-old male C57BL/6 J mice, fed commercial chow (control diet) or methionine and choline-Deficient diet (MCD) for three weeks were subjected to PH and sacrificed 2 weeks later. Livers were removed and submitted to metabolic profiling analysis through RP-LC/MS (qT0F), GC/MS (qT0F) and CE/MS(TOF). More than 3000 different features were detected and repeated measurements one-way ANOVA analysis was performed to unveil significant features. MCD diet induced changes (p < 0.05) in 46% of the detected features, whereas PH provoked significant changes in 85% of them. Most of the changes were detected through LC/MS and were associated to lipid metabolism. However, changes of metabolites virtually related to other metabolic routes (amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleotides) were found altered and detected by CE/MS and GC/MS. The changes associated to PH show a similar trend regardless of the diet, but in the context of the diet deficient in methionine and choline we have found results that point to a different ratio glycolysis/tricarboxylic acid cycle. Moreover, in the NASH model, the regeneration of the liver structures occurs at the expense of an increased phosphatidylethanolamines/phosphatidylcholines ratio. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

A series of 15 compounds were tentatively identified: three glucosinolates, 2 aliphatic (progoitrin and gluconapin) and 1 indolic (glucobrassicin); six chlorogenic acids, four coumaroyl quinic acid (CoQA) isomers and two feruloyl quinic acid (FQA) isomers; two diglycosylated flavonols, one quercetin-derived and one kaempferol-derived; three sinapic acid derivatives, sinapoyl threonic acid, hexose sinapate and a third derivative supposedly attributed to a feruloyl quinic acid sinapate; and finally, a glycosylatedtrans-cinnamic acid which could correspond to feruloylthreonic acid (FTA). Glucosinolates content was 55 times higher in cultivated plants; chlorogenic acids and flavonols increased too by 5 and 3.5 times, respectively. In contrast, sinapates decreased by 3 times in cultivated plants, this last result can be explained by reduced UV-B intensity in the north of Algeria. The change inF. billotiicompound profile was more quantitative rather than qualitative.

The present study aimed to investigate the metabolic profile of 3 genotypes of Conilon and compared them to Robusta Tropical and Arabica coffees, all collected at 3 different levels of ripeness. The extracts were analysed by ESI-LTQ-ORBITRAP, and 11 attributes were evaluated by sensory analysis. To correlate sensory, composition and maturation, chemometric analysis was used. The metabolites trigonelline, caffeine, caffeoylquinic acid and sugars revealed higher concentrations in genotypes 105 and 108. According to the sensorial analysis, genotype 108 showed the highest final score (82), which was even higher than the Arabica coffees. Among the new coffees studied, genotype 108 presented promising characteristics, sparking interest in its national and international commercialization.

A systematic study of the global fungal VOC profiles is still lacking, though it is a prerequisite for elucidating the mechanisms of VOC-mediated interactions. Here we present a versatile system enabling a high-throughput screening of fungal VOCs under controlled temperature. In a proof-of-principle experiment, we characterized the volatile metabolic fingerprints of four Trichoderma spp. over a 48 h growth period. The developed platform allows automated and fast detection of VOCs from up to 14 simultaneously growing fungal cultures in real time. The comprehensive analysis of fungal odors is achieved by employing proton transfer reaction-time of flight-MS and GC-MS. The data-mining strategy based on multivariate data analysis and machine learning allows the volatile metabolic fingerprints to be uncovered. Our data revealed dynamic, development-dependent and extremely species-specific VOC profiles from the biocontrol genus Trichoderma. The two mass spectrometric approaches were highly complementary to each other, together revealing a novel, dynamic view to the fungal VOC release. This analytical system could be used for VOC-based chemotyping of diverse small organisms, or more generally, for any in vivo and in vitro real-time headspace analysis.

Generally, white-fleshed cultivars taste better than yellow-fleshed cultivars. Currently, metabolic causes of differences in taste are unknown, due to the lack of a large-scale and comprehensive investigation of metabolites in loquat fruit. Here, we performed a LC-MS/MS-based widely targeted metabolome analysis on two cultivars, 'Baiyu' (white-fleshed) and 'ZaozhongNo. 6' (yellow-fleshed). A total of 536 metabolites were identified, 193 of which (including 7 carbohydrates, 12 organic acids and 8 amino acids) were different between the cultivars. Pathway enrichment analysis also identified significant differences in phenolic pathways between the cultivars. Our results suggest that taste differences between the cultivars can be explained by variations in composition and abundance of carbohydrates, organic acids, amino acids, and phenolics. This study provides new insights into the underlying metabolic causes of taste variation in loquat.

Determining the comprehensive metabolic signatures of adrenal steroids can provide insight into their metabolic functions and roles in the pathophysiology of adrenal diseases, including Cushing's syndrome (CS) and congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). To this end, we developed an advanced quantitative profiling method of serum adrenal steroids with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) under molecular-specific scan modes. Twenty-seven steroids were separated on a 1.9-mu m particle C18 column (50 x 2.1 mm) at a flow rate of 250 mu L/min and quantified via triple-quadrupole MS with electrospray ionization. During validation, linearities ( r(2)) were higher than 0.940 with a limit of quantification of 0.1-5.0 ng/mL, and precision (coefficient of variation) and accuracy (%bias) of 3.7-14.3 % and 96.3-113.1 %, respectively. In contrast with the significantly increased serum levels of mineralocorticoids (P < 0.001), the present LC-MS assay revealed remarkably decreased levels of all glucocorticoids and androgens in a patient diagnosed with 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency CAH (P < 0.001) compared to those of age- and sex-matched healthy and CS subjects. In the CAH patient, the metabolic ratios for 17 alpha-hydroxylase were significantly decreased, whereas there was no reduction in the metabolic ratio of 17-hydroxyprogesterone to androstenedione, indicating 17,20-lyase activity. In particular, both pregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfates, and their metabolic ratio, were identified as potential biomarkers for 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency (all P < 0.001), which were also distinct from those of CS patients. The devised LC-MS assay clearly revealed the metabolic signatures of 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency, as a rare phenotype of CAH, compared to both healthy and CS subjects, indicating its utility for screening adrenal diseases.

The total content of the four coumaroylspermidine compounds was determined to be 64.86 +/- 0.41% using high-performance liquid chromatography. We then evaluated the anti-depressant effect of CSE by using a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model in rats. Results of sucrose preference tests, open field tests, and forced swimming tests suggest that CSE exhibits a significant anti-depressant effect. In studies to explore the mechanism, CSE was found to inhibit the increases in levels of corticosterone and decreases in levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine, dopamine, and noradrenaline induced by CUMS. Metabolic profiling showed that 10 endogenous metabolites and four metabolic pathways were altered after CSE treatment. Thus, this study not only found a spermidine extract with antidepressant effect from safflower injection residue for the first time but also provided a way for the efficient utilize of safflower injection residue.

To harness urinary metabolic profiling to discover potential biomarkers of septic acute kidney injury in pediatric patients at intensive care units, we collected urine samples from 27 septic children with AKI and 30 septic children without AKI. We used ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF/MS) for profiling and multiple regression analysis to explore the potential biomarkers of sepsis with AKI. We identified a clear distinction in the UPLC-QTOF/MS results for septic children with and without AKI after the development of sepsis, specifically 18 and 17 metabolites with different levels at 12 and 24 h, respectively. Metabolic pathways associated with septic AKI included lipid metabolism, particularly processes involving glycerophospholipid metabolism. L-Histidine, DL-indole-3-lactic acid, trimethylamine N-oxide, and caprylic acid were uncovered as potential biomarkers of septic AKI at 12 h, while gentisaldehyde, 3-ureidopropionate, N4-acetylcytidine, and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol sulfate were identified as potential candidates at 24 h. We further found that combinations of metabolites were more effective diagnostic marker compared with individual metabolites, with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.905 and 0.97 at 12 and 24 h, respectively. Our results indicated that metabolomic analysis could be a promising approach for identifying diagnostic biomarkers of pediatric septic AKI and helped elucidate the pathological mechanisms involved.

The mean total recovery of administered radioactivity was 85.2% with predominant excretion in the urine (78.0%). The radio-chromatographic metabolite profiling showed that most of the total radioactivity in the plasma and the urine was ascribable to metabolites. The UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, and UGT2B7, might have contributed to the interindividual variability in the metabolism and excretion of KD101. The microtracing approach using AMS is a useful tool to evaluate the AME of a drug under development without risk for high radiation exposure to humans.

Jasminum is an important genus in the olive family (Oleaceae), comprising about 200 species distributed all over the world. In the current study, the methanolic extract of Jasminum grandiflorum subsp. floribundum aerial parts and its respective fractions; dichloromethane and n-butanol fractions were analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass (UPLC-HRMS) for profiling and characterization of the plant metabolites. More than seventy metabolites were identified belonging to different classes including phenolic acids, flavonoids, secoiridoids, iridoids, lignans, fatty acids, and triterpenes. The samples were also assessed for their angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) and renin inhibitory activity along with their antioxidant potential using five complementary assays: TAC (total antioxidant capacity), DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl), ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid), FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) and iron reducing power. The results revealed that the n-butanol fraction showed a potent ACE and renin inhibition as compared to Lisinopril and Aliskiren standard drugs (24.66 +/- 2.41 ng/mL vs. 18.37 +/- 1.21 ng/mL and 141.14 +/- 5.28 ng/mL vs. 447.87 +/- 3.2 ng/mL, respectively) and also a strong antioxidant activity. Interestingly, the secoiridoids, dominated metabolites detected in the n-butanol fraction, revealed the potential of them for management of the hypertension diseases. The total extract and fractions were also standardized using HPLC analysis of the major secoiridoid glycoside; oleuropein. Finally, J. grandiflorum standardized extract could be considered as a target for further studies to discover a new therapeutic anti-hypertensive drug.

However, the pathogenesis of laryngeal cancer has been not completely clear. To identify the effects of hypoxia on the invasion, metastasis, and metabolism of laryngeal carcinoma, iTRAQ-labeling-with-LC-MS/MS analysis was performed to identify differentially expressed proteins of the SCC10A cells under hypoxia and normoxia, while metabolites were examined by metabolic profiling. 155 proteins and 180 metabolites were identified and the PCK2 protein was selected for validation by Western Blotting. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to analyze the expression of PCK2 in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections, including laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma tissues from various stages. Collectively, we report that down-regulation of PCK2 inhibits the invasion, migration, and proliferation of laryngeal cancer under hypoxia and down-regulation of PCK2 may be used as a new strategy for laryngeal cancer therapy.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a global metabolic disease, thus, a urinary metabolomics profiling was analyzed to study the anti-diabetic effects and mechanism of stachyose (ST) on high-fat diet- and low dose streptozotocinc-induced T2DM rats. The results showed that ST treatment regulated the level of insulin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides, which demonstrates improvement in T2DM on ST treatment. Urinary samples from the ST and T2DM group were enrolled in metabolomics study, 21 differential metabolites were identified from urinary metabolomics analysis, indicating that the ST treatment partly exerted the anti-diabetes activity by regulating energy metabolism, gut microbiota changes and inflammation. A metabolomics strategy is both suitable and reliable for exploring the anti-diabetes effects and understanding the mechanisms of ST treatment against T2DM.

In this study, bearberry leaves were regarded as studied subject and a reliable method was established to predict the TPC and antioxidant capacity of bearberry leaves. Ultraviolet-visible spectrometry (UV-Vis) and ultra high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS) were used to provide spectral fingerprinting and metabolomic profiling. The data obtained (separately and merged) were used to build partial least squares (PLS) regression model. The PLS model built by using ultraviolet-visible spectra provided a satisfactory prediction result. Mid-level data fusion using the scores significantly improved the performance of PLS regression model, the residual predictive deviations (RPDs) for TPC and alpha, alpha-diphenyl-beta-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) were 6.258 and 6.699, respectively, showing an excellent predictive ability. This study proved the potential of combination of UV-Vis spectrometry and UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS in the prediction of TPC and antioxidant capacity of plant extracts.

In particular, untargeted metabolomics was used to evaluate the impact of the antioxidant extracts on meat quality. The PLE phytochemical profile revealed a wide variety of antioxidant compounds, such as polyphenols, alkaloids, and terpenoids. Multivariate statistics (both unsupervised and supervised) allowed to observe marked differences in BHT and PLE burgers metabolomic profiles during storage. Most of the differences could be attributed to hexanoylcarnitine, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, 6-hydroxypentadecanedioic acid, 9S,11S,15S,20-tetrahydroxy-5Z,13E-prostadienoic acid (20-hydroxy-PGF2a), sativic acid, followed by glycerophospholipids. In addition, significant correlations (p < 0.01) were observed between thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and metabolites related to lipid oxidation processes. Therefore, the approach used showed a clear modulation of lipid oxidation, likely promoted by the plant leaf extract, thus confirming the ability of PLE to delay lipid oxidative phenomena during storage.

J	van der Berg, CL; Venter, G; van der Westhuizen, FH; Erasmus, E				van der Berg, Carien L.; Venter, Gerda; van der Westhuizen, Francois H.; Erasmus, Elardus			Data on the optimisation of a solid phase extraction method for fractionating estrogen metabolites from small urine volumes	DATA IN BRIEF			English	Article; Data Paper						Estrogen metabolism; Solid phase extraction; LC-MS/MS; Method optimisation		Certain estrogen metabolites have been implicated in the pathophysiology of breast cancer. Moreover, the estrogen metabolite profiles of healthy women and those with (a high risk of) breast cancer differ significantly. The development of an analytical method to determine the relative levels of all the estrogen biotransformation products has been described in van der Berg et al. [1]. An improvement on previously developed methods was the ability to also detect molecules such as sulphate and glucuronide conjugates as well as progesterone, estradiol precursors, and metabolites from the 16-hydroxylation metabolic pathway of estrogens simultaneously with all other estrogen metabolites. The data presented here describe the optimisation of a solid phase extraction method with different fractionation steps for LC-MS/MS analysis of 27 estrogen-related metabolites from small urine volumes. Conditions that were optimised include the elution and washing solvent concentration, the urine, loading, washing, and elution volumes, as well as pH. All raw data used to construct the bar graphs presented in this article are included in the supplementary data file. The data indicated that fractionation was necessary in order to elute estrogen metabolites with different chemical properties at different eluate compositions.

(PM) induced DILI (PM-DILI) have received much attention This study aimed to identify a simple and high-efficiency approach to PM-DILI diagnosis via metabolomics analysis. Methods: Plasma metabolites in 13 PM-DILI patients were profiled by liquid chromatography along with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Meanwhile, the metabolic characteristics of the PM-DILI were compared with that of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), hepatitis B (HBV), and healthy volunteers. Results: Twenty-four metabolites were identified to present significantly different levels in PM-DILI patients compared with HBV and AIH groups. These metabolites were enriched into glucose, amino acids, and sphingolipids metabolisms. Among these essential metabolites, the ratios of P-cresol sulfate vs. phenylalanine and inosine vs. bilirubin were further selected using a stepwise decision tree to construct a classification model in order to differentiate PM-DILI from HBV and AIH. The model was highly effective with sensitivity of 92.3% and specificity of 88.9%. Conclusions: This study presents an integrated view of the metabolic features of PM-DILI induced by herbal medicine, and the four-metabolite decision tree technique imparts a potent tool in clinical diagnosis.

In this study, urine metabolomics was first analysed to explore the therapeutic mechanisms of HQT in UC rats induced by TNBS. We identified 28 potential biomarkers affected by HQT that might cause changes in urine metabolism in UC rats, mapped the network of metabolic pathways, and revealed how HQT affects metabolism of UC rats. The results showed that UC affects amino acid metabolism and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and impairs the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle). UC induced inflammatory and gastrointestinal reactions by inhibiting the transport of fatty acids and disrupting amino acid metabolism. HQT plays key roles via regulating the level of biomarkers in the metabolism of amino acids, lipids, and so on, normalizing metabolic disorders. In addition, histopathology and other bioinformatics analysis further confirm that HQT altered UC rat physiology and pathology, ultimately affecting metabolic function of UC rats.

MG7-G1, it reacts with strongly induced droplet production on its aerial mycelium. Initially the metabolite profile of droplets fromS. violaceoruberin co-culture withStreptomycessp. MG7-G1 was compared to samples fromS. violaceoruberin single-culture by using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). Then, the exudate from agar plates of co-cultures and single cultures (after freezing and thawing) was also analysed. Several compounds were only observed whenS. violaceoruberwas grown in co-culture. Based on their high-resolution ESI mass spectra and their comparable retention times to the calcium-dependent antibiotics (CDAs) produced byS. violaceoruber, the new compounds were suspected to be deacylated calcium-dependent antibiotics (daCDAs), lacking the 2,3-epoxyhexanoyl residue of CDAs. This was verified by detailed analysis of the MS/MS spectra of the daCDAs in comparison to the CDAs. The major CDA compounds present in calcium ion-supplemented agar medium of co-cultures were daCDAs, thus suggesting thatStreptomycessp. MG7-G1 expresses a deacylase that degrades CDAs.

The variations in the metabolism of nicotine and tobacco-derived carcinogens in these groups were reported previously with the levels of nicotine metabolites and carcinogen-derived metabolites measured using targeted approaches. While useful, these targeted strategies are not able to detect global metabolic changes for use in predicting the detrimental effects of tobacco use and ultimately lung cancer susceptibility among smokers. To address this limitation, we have performed global untargeted metabolomics profiling in urine of AA and white smokers to characterize the pattern of metabolites, identi differentially regulated pathways, and correlate these profiles with the observed variations in lung cancer risk between these two populations. Urine samples from AA (n = 30) and white (n = 30) smokers were used for metabolomics analysis acquired in both positive and negative electrospray ionization modes. LC-MS data were uploaded onto the cloud-based XCMS online (http://xcmsonline.scripps.edu) platform for retention time correction, alignment, feature detection, annotation, statistical analysis, data visualization, and automated systems biology pathway analysis. The latter identified global differences in the metabolic pathways in the two groups including the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, nucleotides, fatty acids, and nicotine. Significant differences in the nicotine degradation pathway (cotinine glucuronidation) in the two groups were observed and confirmed using a targeted LC-MS/MS approach. These results are consistent with previous studies demonstrating AA smokers with lower glucuronidation capacity compared to whites. Furthermore, the n-glucuronate degradation pathway was found to be significantly different between the two populations, with lower amounts of the putative metabolites detected in AA compared to whites. We hypothesize that the differential regulation of the D-glucuronate degradation pathway is a consequence of the variations in the glucuronidation capacity observed in the two groups. Other pathways including the metabolism of amino acids, nucleic acids, and fatty acids were also identified, however, the biological relevance and implications of these differences across ethnic groups need further investigation. Overall, the applied metabolomics approach revealed global differences in the metabolic networks and endogenous metabolites in AA and whites, which could be used and validated as a new potential panel of biomarkers that could be used to predict lung cancer susceptibility among smokers in population-based studies.

An original statistical analysis involving ion ratios, discriminant analysis, and genetic algorithm (GA) was then applied to study the discrimination of rose wines according to their origins. After noise reduction and ion peak alignments on the mass spectra, about 14 000 different signals were detected. The use of an in-house mass spectrometry database allowed us to assign 72 molecules. Then, a genetic algorithm was applied on two series of samples (learning and validation sets), each composed of 30 commercial wines from three different wine producing regions of France. Excellent results were obtained with only four diagnostic peaks and two ion ratios. This new approach could be applied to other aspects of wine production but also to other metabolomics studies.

Significant and similar changes in the levels of 283 biochemical metabolites were associated with the three treatments compared with solvent control samples. Overall. the three treatments generated similar global biochemical profiles, with some minor differences associated with rotenone treatment. All three treatments resulted in a shift in energy metabolism as demonstrated by decreased glycogen stores and glycolysis. A reduced antioxidant response was detected in cells following all treatments. In addition, bile acid biosynthesis decreased as a potential consequence of increased oxidative stress by all three treatments. Conversely. rotenone treatment induced a number of changes after 1 hr, which were not detected in FCCP- or (+)-usnic acid-treated samples; these changes were not sustained over time and included increased NAD+ salvage and lysine degradation. In conclusion. these biochemical profiles could provide new insights into the mechanism(s) of mitochondrial toxicity.

Proline metabolism affects many crucial processes at the cellular level, including collagen biosynthesis, redox balance, energetic processes as well as intracellular signaling. The study aimed to develop a robust and easy-to-use targeted metabolomics method for the determination of the intracellular level of proline and the other two amino acids closely related to proline metabolism: glutamic acid and arginine. The method employs hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography followed by high-resolution, accurate-mass mass spectrometry for reliable detection and quantification of the target metabolites in cell lysates. The sample preparation consisted of quenching by the addition of ice-cold methanol and subsequent cell scraping into a quenching solution. The method validation showed acceptable linearity (r > 0.995), precision (%RSD < 15%), and accuracy (88.5-108.5%). Pilot research using HaCaT spontaneously immortalized human keratinocytes in a model for wound healing was performed, indicating the usefulness of the method in studies of disturbances in proline metabolism. The developed method addresses the need to determine the intracellular concentration of three key amino acids and can be used routinely in targeted mammalian cell culture metabolomics research.

Blood pressure (BP) lowering was previously reported in adults with the TT genotype, in response to supplementation with the MTHFR cofactor, riboflavin. Whether the BP phenotype associated with the polymorphism is related to perturbed one-carbon metabolism is unknown. This study investigated one-carbon metabolites and their responsiveness to riboflavin in adults with the TT genotype. Plasma samples from adults (n 115) screened for the MTHFR genotype, who previously participated in RCTs to lower BP, were analysed for methionine, S-adenosylmethionine ( SAM), S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), betaine, choline and cystathionine by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The one-carbon metabolite response to riboflavin (1.6 mg/d; n 24) or placebo (n 23) for 16 weeks in adults with the TT genotype was also investigated. Plasma SAM (74.7 +/- 21.0 vs 85.2 +/- 22.6 nmol/L, P = 0.013) and SAM:SAH ratio (1.66 +/- 0.55 vs 1.85 +/- 0.51, P = 0.043) were lower and plasma homocysteine was higher (P = 0.043) in TT, compared to CC individuals. In response to riboflavin, SAM (P = 0.008) and cystathionine (P = 0.045) concentrations increased, with no responses in other one-carbon metabolites observed. These findings confirm perturbed one-carbon metabolism in individuals with the MTHFR 677TT genotype, and for the first time demonstrate that SAM, and cystathionine, increase in response to riboflavin supplementation in this genotype group. The genotype-specific, one-carbon metabolite responses to riboflavin intervention observed could offer some insight into the role of this gene-nutrient interaction in blood pressure.

The aim of this study was to characterize the metabolites of ponatinib in human liver microsomes as well as its reactive metabolites. Ponatinib was incubated with human liver microsomes in the presence of NADPH and trapping agents (glutathione or potassium cyanide). The metabolites were characterized by liquid chromatography in combination with Q-Exactive-Orbitrap-MS. Under the current conditions, six metabolites were detected and structurally identified on the basis of their accurate masses, fragmentation patterns, and retention times. M3 (N-demethylation) was unambiguously identified by matching its retention time and fragment ions with those of its reference standard. N-demethylation and oxygenation were proved to be the predominant metabolic pathways of ponatinib. In addition, two reactive metabolites (cyano adducts) were detected in human liver microsomes in the presence of potassium cyanide and NADPH, suggesting that ponatinib underwent CYP450-mediated metabolic activation, which could be one of the causative mechanisms for its hepatotoxicity. The current study provides new information regarding the metabolic profiles of ponatinib and would be helpful in understanding the effectiveness and toxicity of ponatinib, especially the mechanism of hepatotoxicity.

Renal involvement defines late morbidity of the disease. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of the progression to kidney disease and predictive biomarkers are required for better management of IgAV and its nephritis (IgAVN). Objectives: An untargeted metabolomics approach was performed to reveal the underlying molecular mechanism of disease pathogenesis and to define potential biomarkers from plasma samples from IgAV and IgAVN patients. Methods: Forty-five active IgAV patients (H) and six healthy controls (C) were enrolled in the study. Plasma samples were collected on the same day of diagnosis and before any immunosuppressive treatment was initiated. At the time of diagnosis and sample collection, none of the patients had renal involvement. We used Quadrupole Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (Q-TOF LC/MS) to investigate the alterations in plasma metabolomic profiles. Three separate pools were created: healthy controls (group C), active IgAV patients who did not develop renal involvement (group H), and patients who developed IgAVN at follow up (group N). Peak picking, grouping, and comparison parts were performed via XCMS (https://xcmsonline.scripps.edu/) software. Results: At follow-up, IgAVN developed in 6 out of 45 IgAV patients. The median time of renal involvement development is 23 days (range 5-45 days). Of these, 3 had nephritic proteinuria, one had nephrotic proteinuria, and 2 had microscopic hematuria. There were no significant differences in gender, age, clinical manifestations, and laboratory findings between the six patients who developed renal involvement and those who did not. In multivariate analysis, there was no significant association between any of the defined demographic and clinical characteristics (male sex, gastrointestinal system involvement, joint involvement, CRP, WBC, PLT) and the occurrence of renal involvement. Totally 2618 peaks were detected for group H, N, and C. Among them, 355 peaks were found to be statistically significant and reliable (p 0.05), and 155 of these peaks were found to be changed (fold change 1.5) between the groups C and H, and 66 peaks were found to be changed (fold change >1.5) between the groups H and N. The number of the peaks on the intersection of the peaks found to be different between the groups (C and H) and (H and N) was 39. Based on putative identification results, 15 putatively identified metabolites matched with 11 peaks were presented as biomarker candidates after careful evaluation with a clinical perspective. Conclusion: We suggest that DHAP (18:0), prostaglandin D2/I2, porphobilinogen, 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, and N-Acetyl-4-O-acetylneuraminic acid/N-Acetyl-7-O-acetylneuraminic acid may serve as biomarkers for predicting kidney disease. Future studies with larger groups of IgAV patients are needed to validate the identified metabolic profile. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Secoiridoids, hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, phenolic acid, and flavones, are the main nutraceutical substances of EVOO. Applications of beneficial microbes and/or their metabolites impact the plant metabolome. In this study the effects of application of selected Trichoderma strains or their effectors (secondary metabolites) on the phenolic compounds content and antioxidant potential of the EVOOs have been evaluated. For this purpose, Trichoderma virens (strain GV41) and Trichoderma harzianum (strain T22), well-known biocontrol agents, and two their metabolites harzianic acid (HA) and 6-pentyl-alpha -pyrone (6PP) were been used to treat plants of Olea europaea var. Leccino and var. Carolea. Then the nutraceutical potential of EVOO was evaluated. Total phenolic content was estimated by Folin-Ciocalteau's assay, metabolic profile by High-Resolution Mass spectroscopy (HRMS-Orbitrap), and antioxidant activity by DPPH and ABTS assays. Our results showed that in the cultivation of the olive tree, T22 and its metabolites improve the nutraceutical value of the EVOOs modulating the phenolic profile and improving antioxidants activity.

The metabolism of three major nutrients (sugar, lipid, and protein) will change during pregnancy, especially in the second trimester. The present study is aimed at evaluating carnitine alteration in fatty acid metabolism in the second trimester of pregnancy and the correlation between carnitine and GDM.Methods. 450 pregnant women were recruited in the present prospective study. Metabolic profiling of 31 carnitines was detected by LC-MS/MS in these women. Correlation between carnitine metabolism and maternal and neonatal complication with GDM was analyzed.Results. We found the levels of 7 carnitines increased inage >35, BMI >= 30, weight gain >20 kg, and ART pregnant groups, but the level of free carnitine (C0) decreased. Nine carnitines were specific metabolites of GDM. Prepregnancy BMI, weight gain, and carnitines (C0, C3, and C16) were independent risk factors associated with GDM and related macrosomia. C0 was negatively correlated with FBG, LDL, TG, and TC. A nomogram was developed for predicting macrosomia in GDM based on carnitine-related metabolic variables.Conclusion. The carnitine metabolism in the second trimester is abnormal in GDM women. The dysfunction of carnitine metabolism is closely related to the abnormality of blood lipid and glucose in GDM. Carnitine metabolism abnormality could predict macrosomia complicated with GDM.

In this study, for the first timeVigna unguiculataL. Walp. (cowpea) water boiled seed extracts were found to reduce the viability of different colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines, such as E705, DiFi and SW480 and the proliferation of Caco-2 line too, without affecting CCD841 healthy cell line. Furthermore, the extracts showed the ability to reduce the level of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation in E705, DiFi and SW480 cell lines and to lower the EC50 of a CRC common drug, cetuximab, on E705 and DiFi lines from 161.7 ng mL(-1)to 0.06 ng mL(-1)and from 49.5 ng mL(-1)to 0.2 ng mL(-1)respectively. The extract was characterized in its protein and metabolite profiles by tandem mass spectrometry and(1)H-NMR analyses. A Bowman-Birk protease inhibitor was identified within the protein fraction and was supposed to be the main active component. These findings confirm the importance of a legume-based diet to prevent the outbreak of many CRC and to reduce the amount of drug administered during a therapeutic cycle.

As currently the study of indigenous varieties is of particular importance, the subject of this work was detailed characterization of phenolic compounds in the autochthonous grapevine variety Vranac, from the Montenegrin Podgorica subregion. Phenolic profiles of leaves, berries (skin, seeds, and pulp were examined separately) and young monovarietal wine were determined using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) with linear trap quadrupole (LTQ)-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometry (MS). Total phenolic content (TPC) and radical scavenging activity (RSA) were higher for the grape seeds extracts, followed by extracts of grape skins and pulps. As expected, the total anthocyanin content (TAC) was higher in grape skin than in wine. A total of one hundred twenty nine compounds (forty two phenolic acids and their derivatives, twenty three flavan-3-ols, twenty one flavanols, five stilbenes and thirty eight anthocyanins) were identified in the investigated extracts. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of tentative identification of (epi)catechin 3-O-coumarate in grape seed and chalcan-flavan 3-ol dimers in wine and grape seed.

The molecular changes of hippocampal and cortical dysfunction in the process of TBI are poorly understood, especially their chronic effects on metabolic profiles. Here we utilize metabolomics-based liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry coupled with bioinformatics method to assess the perturbation of brain metabolism in rat hippocampus and cortex on day 7. The results revealed a signature panel which consisted of 13 identified metabolites to facilitate targeted interventions for subacute TBI discrimination. Purine metabolism change in cortical tissue and taurine and hypotaurine metabolism change in hippocampal tissue were detected. Furthermore, the associations between the metabolite markers and the perturbed pathways were analyzed based on databases: 64 enzyme and one pathway were evolved in TBI. The findings represented significant profiling changes and provided unique metabolite-protein information in a rat model of TBI following the subacute phase. This study may inspire scientists and doctors to further their studies and provide potential therapy targets for clinical interventions.

Gleditsia sinensisLam. is a woody species that can tolerate various drought conditions and has been widely used in all aspects of life, including medicine, food, cleaning products, and landscaping. However, few reports have focused on the regulatory mechanism of the drought response inG. sinensis. To understand the metabolic basis of theGleditsia sinensisdrought response, different tissues were subjected to a rehydration/dehydration treatment and subsequently analyzed using untargeted and targeted metabolomics profiling depending on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass (LC-MS) analytical platforms, respectively. Eight sugars, twelve amino acids, and twenty phenolic compounds were characterized. Metabolites showing a significant increase or decrease under drought stress were considered to be the key metabolites of interest for a better understanding of the drought tolerance mechanisms. The GC-MS-identified compounds were shown to undergo tissue-specific regulation in response to drought stress. Moreover, the C6C3C6 and C6C3 structures were identified by LC-MS as phenolic metabolites, which revealed their drought-response association. Significant physiological parameters were measured, including overall plant development, and the results showed that antioxidant systems could not be completely restored, but photosynthetic parameters could be recovered. The results of this research provide insight into biochemical component information mechanism of drought resistance inG. sinensis.

Buxue Yimu granule (BYG) is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine prescription composed of five kinds of drugs and is widely used in gynecology and obstetrics. The aim of the present study was to establish the quality standard of BYG and investigate its protective effect on incomplete abortion. The chemical fingerprint of BYG was established by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The major compounds of BYG were determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. An incomplete abortion rat model was induced by intragastric administration of mifepristone (8.3 mg center dot kg(-1)) combined with misoprostol (100.0 mu g center dot kg(-1)) during early pregnancy. The serum levels of human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG), estradiol (E-2), and progesterone (PG) were determined. The serum endogenous metabolites were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS). Multivariate analysis, including partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), was employed to analyze the metabolic profiles, and MetaboAnalyst was used to investigate the metabolic pathways. Furthermore, hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE) was used to evaluate the histopathological changes in uterine tissue. The expression levels of VEGFA and NF-kappa B were detected by immunohistochemistry. The results indicated that HPLC fingerprint analysis can be successfully used to assess the quality of BYG. The medical-induced incomplete abortion rats were clearly separated from control rats, and the biochemical changes were gradually restored to normal after administration of BYG. Moreover, 19 potential biomarkers, including N-lactoylleucine, 2-piperidinone, isobutyryl-l-carnitine, eicosapentaenoylcholine, LysoPC(14:0), LysoPC(20:5), physagulin C, LysoPC(18:3), leukotriene D5, deoxycholic acid 3-glucuronide, glycine, pregnanediol 3-O-glucuronide, LysoPC(18:2), LysoPC(17:0/0:0), N-acetyl-leukotriene E4, LysoPC(18:0), platelet-activating factor, LysoPA(24:1), and LysoPC(18:1), which were mainly related to the amino acids metabolism, lipids metabolism, and bile acid biosynthesis, were identified. Consequently, BYG exerts a potential protective role in the intervention of incomplete abortion by anti-inflammatory, promote endometrial repair, and regulate the metabolic disorders.

Many factors alter flavor quality. Disease affects aroma and flavonoid constituents, causing off-flavors in plants. Huanglongbing (HLB) disease negatively affects citrus, although lemons are more tolerant. Lemon juice quality of HLB-affected fruits is not well studied. Lemon juice aroma-active compounds were profiled in this study using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry-olfactometry, and other metabolites contributing to overall flavor quality were investigated. Lemon juice from different rootstocks was discriminated using the metabolic profile. Flavor and other lemon juice metabolites also distinguished symptomatic from asymptomatic trees. Pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that biosynthesis pathways of the Phosphotransf erase system (PTS), and Starch and sucrose metabolism involving fructose, glucose and sucrose, were highly influenced by HLB status. This study provides the first comprehensive view of lemon juice metabolites, including alterations resulting from rootstock differences or disease severity.

The aim of the study was to select a prebiotic for the chosen probiotic strains to create a synbiotic. The impact of prebiotics (inulin, maltodextrin, corn starch, beta-glucan, and apple pectin) on fiveLactobacillusspp. strains' growth and metabolites synthesis (lactic, acetic, propionic, and butyric acids, ethanol, and acetaldehyde) was tested by the plate count method and by high-performance liquid chromatography, respectively. Moreover, the differences in the ratio of D(-) and L(+) lactate isomers produced byLactobacillusspp., as well as variations in the probiotics' enzymatic profiles associated with the prebiotic used for cultivation, were determined with a Megazyme rapid assay kit and API(R)ZYM assay, accordingly. Finally, the influence of the carbon source (prebiotic) used on the antagonistic activity of the probiotic strains towards pathogenic bacteria, such asSalmonellaspp. orListeria monocytogeneswas analyzed in the co-cultures. The results showed that the growth, metabolic profile, and antagonistic activity of the probiotics towards selected pathogens were the most favorable when 2% (w/v) of inulin was used. Therefore, the combination of inulin with selected probiotics is a promising synbiotic mixture.

Over the last decade, large numbers of new psychoactive substances (NPS) have entered the drug market and these pose a worldwide problem to human health. Metabolomics approaches are useful tools for simultaneous detection of endogenous metabolites affected by drug use. They allow identification of pathways or characteristic metabolites, which might support the understanding of pharmacological actions or act as indirect biomarkers of consumption behavior or analytical detectability. Herein, we performed a comparative metabolic profiling of three psychoactive stimulant drugs 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), amphetamine and the NPS mephedrone by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) in order to identify common pathways or compounds. Plasma samples were obtained from controlled administration studies to humans. Various metabolites were identified as increased or decreased based on drug intake, mainly belonging to energy metabolism, steroid biosynthesis and amino acids. Linoleic acid and pregnenolone-sulfate changed similarly in response to intake of all drugs. Overall, mephedrone produced a profile more similar to that of amphetamine than MDMA in terms of affected energy metabolism. These data can provide the basis for further in-depth targeted metabolome studies on pharmacological actions and search for biomarkers of drug use.

The approach considers four questions that often present themselves to medicinal chemists optimizing their compounds for candidate selection: (1) What are the important clearance mechanisms that mediate the disposition of my molecule? (2) Can metabolic liabilities be modulated in a favorable way? (3) Does my compound undergo bioactivation to a reactive metabolite? (4) Do any of the metabolites possess activity, either on- or off-target? An additional question necessary to support compound development relates to metabolites in safety testing (MIST) and our approach also addresses this question. The value in structural elucidation is derived from its application to better design molecules, guide their clinical development, and underwrite patient safety.	[Cerny, Matthew A.; Obach, R.

In this study, we examined the levels of intracellular iron, malondialdehyde, and reactive oxygen species after Ori treatment, while interfering with the effects of Ori with ferroptosis inhibitor, demonstrating that Ori's inhibition of TE1 cell proliferation is associated with ferroptosis. To understand the molecular mechanism of Ori, we performed UPLC-MS/MS metabolomics profiling on TE1 cells, which show that gamma-glutamyl amino acids (gamma-glutamylleucine, gamma-glutamylvaline), 5-oxoproline, glutamate, GSH, and GSSG are changed significantly after Ori treatment. Meanwhile, the activity of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase 1 (GGT1) decreased. This revealed that Ori inhibited the gamma-glutamyl cycle in TE1 cells. Furthermore, we found that Ori can covalently bind to cysteine to form the conjugate oridonin-cysteine (Ori-Cys), resulting in the inhibition of glutathione synthesis, which is consistent with the decrease in the enzymatic activity of glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC). Eventually, the value of intracellular GSH/GSSG was reduced, and the enzymatic activity of the glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) was significantly decreased. In conclusion, our experiments indicated that Ori can inhibit the gamma-glutamyl cycle, thereby inducing ferroptosis to exert anti-cancer activity.

Comparative primary metabolic and lipidomic profiling of freshwater and marine Synechocystis strains is needed to understand the physiological characteristics of each strain at molecular level. In this study, we performed comparative primary metabolic and lipidomic profiling of freshwater Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter Synechocystis 6803) and marine Synechocystis sp. PCC 7338 (hereafter Synechocystis 7338) by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and nano electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. Neophytadiene, phytol, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) were significantly higher in Synechocystis 6803. Levels of alanine, aspartic acid, valine, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, oleic acid, plamitic acid, stearic acid, glucosylglycerol, sucrose, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and diacylglyceryltrimethylhomoserine (DGTS) (only detected in Synechocystis 7338) were significantly higher in Synechocystis 7338. Our results provide basic information to choose Synechocystis strains for various industrial usages, and also provide fundamental information on the future development of novel Synechocystis strains to produce high levels of specific metabolites by metabolic pathway modulation.

Therefore, convenient methodologies to perform wide-ranging evaluation of their functions in nature and potential human benefits (e.g., for drug discovery applications) are desired. This protocol describes the combination of genome mining (GM) and molecular networking (MN), two contemporary approaches that match gene cluster-encoded annotations in whole genome sequencing with chemical structure signatures from crude metabolic extracts. This is the first step towards the discovery of new natural entities. These concepts, when applied together, are defined here as MS-guided genome mining. In this method, the main components are previously designated (using MN), and structurally related new candidates are associated with genome sequence annotations (using GM). Combining GM and MN is a profitable strategy to target new molecule backbones or harvest metabolic profiles in order to identify analogues from already known compounds.

Metabolomics of primary cutaneous melanoma and matched adjacent extratumoral microenvironment	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MALIGNANT-MELANOMA; EXPRESSION; METABOANALYST; FIBROBLASTS; RECEPTOR; PATTERNS; ACID; MITOCHONDRIA; METABOLISM; CAVEOLIN-1	Background Melanoma causes the vast majority of deaths attributable to skin cancer, largely due to its propensity for metastasis. To date, few studies have examined molecular changes between primary cutaneous melanoma and adjacent putatively normal skin. To broaden temporal inferences related to initiation of disease, we performed a metabolomics investigation of primary melanoma and matched extratumoral microenvironment (EM) tissues; and, to make inferences about progressive disease, we also compared unmatched metastatic melanoma tissues to EM tissues. Methods Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolic profiling was performed on frozen human tissues. Results We observed 824 metabolites as differentially abundant among 33 matched tissue samples, and 1,118 metabolites as differentially abundant between metastatic melanoma (n = 46) and EM (n = 34) after false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment (p<0.01). No significant differences in metabolite abundances were noted comparing primary and metastatic melanoma tissues. Conclusions Overall, pathway-based results significantly distinguished melanoma tissues from EM in the metabolism of: ascorbate and aldarate, propanoate, tryptophan, histidine, and pyrimidine. Within pathways, the majority of individual metabolite abundances observed in comparisons of primary melanoma vs. EM and metastatic melanoma vs. EM were directionally consistent. This observed concordance suggests most identified compounds are implicated in the initiation or maintenance of melanoma.

However, the risk evaluation of the use of GMs is mandatory before their release in the market. In this paper, an untargeted and comprehensive nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomic study was carried out on the peel and flesh of a transgenic lemon clone (E23) expressing the chit42 gene and exhibiting an increased tolerance to some pathogenic fungi and on its wild type. Results highlighted a substantial equivalence of the metabolomics profile of the transgenic clone compared to the wild type. In addition, an enhanced response of the E23 clone toward fungal pathogens affecting the postharvest management in lemon was evidenced. These results confirm the potential of genetic engineering for the punctual modification of specific agronomic traits without altering the whole pattern of metabolites and open new perspectives for a more sustainable and effective management of specific postharvest diseases in citrus.

We profiled the peripheral blood from patients during the second trimester of pregnancy and three months, and one year postpartum. In the GDM group Arg, Gln, His, Met, Phe and Ser were downregulated with statistical significance in comparison to normoglycemic (NGT) women. From the analysis of the association of all amino acid profiles of GDM and NGT women, several statistical models predicting diabetic status were formulated and compared with the literature, with the arginine-based model as the most promising of the screened ones (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.749). Our research results have shed light on the critical role of arginine in the development of GDM and may help in precisely distinguishing between GDM and NGT and earlier detection of GDM but also in predicting women with the increased type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) risk.

In this study, color, pH and brix of the fruit samples were measured and an unbiased LCMS-based metabolomics approach was applied. Based on Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) of the relative abundance levels of > 250 metabolites, it could be concluded that fruit size was the most influential to the biochemical composition, rather than the geographical origin of accessions. Results indicated substantial biodiversity in various metabolites generally regarded as key to fruit quality aspects, including sugars; phenolic compounds like phenylpropanoids and flavonoids; alkaloids and glycosides of flavour-related volatile compounds. The phytochemical data provides insight into which Turkish accessions might be most promising as starting materials for the tomato processing and breeding industries.

Var. spinosa (Bunge) Hu ex H. F. Chou (LZJS), is currently used as a healthy tea in China. This study evaluated the chemical components and antioxidant activities of LZJS flavonoid (LZJSF) and fermented LZJSF (FLZJSF) using human intestinal bacteria (HIB) through dynamic fermentation. Eighteen flavonoids were simultaneously identified in LZJSF using UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS method, nine of which were targeted for a HIB metabolism study. Seven small phenolic acids were identified in FLZJSF. Not only at chemical level but also at PC12 cell level, FLZJSF samples fermented for 4 and 6 h showed significant positive correlation between their activities and flavonoid aglycones, which were transformed from LZJSF. However, FLZJSF samples (8 h and longer time) mainly contained phenolic acids and indicated weak activities. Thus, LZJSF was found to result in increased antioxidant activity and could be commercially utilized as a novel functional food.

The aim of the presented investigation was the transfer of biopartitioning micellar chromatography (BMC) proposed by Medina-Hernandez and co-workers to micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC). Therefore, biopartitioning micellar electrokinetic chromatography (BMEKC) was demonstrated as an alternative tool for estimation of biological properties of drug candidates. To simplify the data processing of developed approach and increase the assay throughput, the application of apparent retention factor (k(app)) was proposed. Based on introduced k(app), simple molecular descriptors, protein binding constant and biological properties like blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, quantitative retention-activity relationships (QRARs) models were established. These results indicated usefulness of BMEKC method. In comparison to BMC, the proposed BMEKC method offers significant reduction of reagents consumption which meet green analytical chemistry principles.

J	Ding, ZF				Ding, Zhengfeng			Lipid metabolism disorders contribute to the pathogenesis of Hepatospora eriocheir in the crab Eriocheir sinensis	JOURNAL OF FISH DISEASES			English	Article						Eriocheir sinensis; Hepatospora eriocheir; lipidomics; pathogenesis	IN-SITU HYBRIDIZATION; PCR ASSAYS; MICROSPORIDIA; ADAPTATION; INFECTION	The microsporidia Hepatospora eriocheir has been identified as an emerging pathogenic agent in the commercial crab Eriocheir sinensis. Histology analysis indicated that hepatopancreas was a significant target for H. eriocheir infection. However, the functional consequences of such tissue tropism remain poorly studied. Considering that hepatopancreas was a centre for lipid metabolism and energy supply, we furtherly investigated the comparative lipid metabolism profiles between the control and H. eriocheir-infected hepatopancreas by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based lipidomics approach. Results confirmed that H. eriocheir induced apparent alterations of lipid metabolic phenotypes in hepatopancreas. Sixty-seven lipids, including triglyceride (TG), diglyceride (DG), sphingomyelin (SM), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylinositol (PI), ceramide (CER), hexosyl ceramide (HEX CER) and (o-acyl)-1-hydroxy fatty acid (OAHFA), were significantly changed and could be determined as effective biomarkers. TG and DG accounted for the largest proportion (58.2% and 11.9%, respectively). Notably, over 94% of the distinguished lipids presented a similar modified trend with profoundly reduced contents, implying blatant energy exploitation of the parasite. These lipids were involved in pathways of energy and lipid metabolism and signal regulation. Such information suggests that H. eriocheir possibly "starves" the host via destructing hepatopancreas tissue together with appropriate host energy resources, leading to the corresponding alterations of lipid metabolism and a decrease in the colour of the hepatopancreas.

Although many molecules have been identified as neurotransmitters, technical limitations have precluded a full metabolomic analysis of SV content. Here, we present a workflow to rapidly isolate SVs and to interrogate their metabolic contents at high-resolution using mass spectrometry. We validated the enrichment of glutamate in SVs of primary cortical neurons using targeted polar metabolomics. Unbiased and extensive global profiling of SVs isolated from these neurons revealed that the only detectable polar metabolites they contain are the established neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA. In addition, we adapted the approach to enable quick capture of SVs directly from brain tissue and determined the neurotransmitter profiles of diverse brain regions in a cell-type-specific manner. The speed, robustness, and precision of this method to interrogate SV contents will facilitate novel insights into the chemical basis of neurotransmission.

Single-cell metabolic profiling of human cytotoxic T cells	NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article							MASS CYTOMETRY; TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT; IMMUNE; EXPRESSION; MARKER; DRIVER	An antibody-based method enables profiling of metabolic protein expression and regulation in single cells using mass spectrometry. Cellular metabolism regulates immune cell activation, differentiation and effector functions, but current metabolic approaches lack single-cell resolution and simultaneous characterization of cellular phenotype. In this study, we developed an approach to characterize the metabolic regulome of single cells together with their phenotypic identity. The method, termed single-cell metabolic regulome profiling (scMEP), quantifies proteins that regulate metabolic pathway activity using high-dimensional antibody-based technologies. We employed mass cytometry (cytometry by time of flight, CyTOF) to benchmark scMEP against bulk metabolic assays by reconstructing the metabolic remodeling of in vitro-activated naive and memory CD8(+)T cells. We applied the approach to clinical samples and identified tissue-restricted, metabolically repressed cytotoxic T cells in human colorectal carcinoma. Combining our method with multiplexed ion beam imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF), we uncovered the spatial organization of metabolic programs in human tissues, which indicated exclusion of metabolically repressed immune cells from the tumor-immune boundary. Overall, our approach enables robust approximation of metabolic and functional states in individual cells.

In this study, we analyze exhaled breath condensate (EBC) in asthmatic children before (T0) and after (T1) a three-week course of inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP). Methods: we recruited steroid-naive asthmatic children for whom inhaled steroids were indicated and healthy children, evaluating asthma control, spirometry and EBC (in asthmatics at T0 and T1). A liquid-chromatography-mass-spectrometry untargeted analysis was applied to EBC and a mass spectrometry-based target analysis to urine samples. Results: metabolomic analysis discriminated asthmatic (n = 26) from healthy children (n = 16) at T0 and T1, discovering 108 and 65 features relevant for the discrimination, respectively. Searching metabolomics databases, seven putative biomarkers with a plausible role in asthma biochemical-metabolic processes were found. After BDP treatment, asthmatic children, in the face of an improved asthma control (p < 0.001) and lung function (p = 0.01), showed neither changes in EBC metabolomic profile nor in urinary endogenous steroid profile. Conclusions: "breathomics" can discriminate asthmatic from healthy children, with prostaglandin, fatty acid and glycerophospholipid as putative markers. The three-week course of BDP-in spite of a significant clinical improvement-was not associated with changes in EBC metabolic arrangement and urinary steroid profile.

Tecoma is a medicinally-valuable genus in the Bignoniaceae family, with some of its species exhibiting anti-HIV activity. This encouraged us to conduct an in silico exploration of some phytocompounds in Tecoma species cultivated in Egypt, namely Tecoma capensis and its four varieties i.e. yellow, harmony, pink and red, T. grandiflora Loisel., T. radicans L., and one hybrid i.e. Tecoma x smithii W. Watson. LC/MS-based metabolite profiling of the studied Tecoma plants resulted in the dereplication of 12 compounds (1-12) belonging to different phytochemical classes viz. alkaloids, iridoids, flavonoids and fatty acid esters. The in silico inhibitory action of these compounds against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein C-terminal domain in complex with human ACE2 was assessed via molecular docking.

Eating, Sleep, and Social Patterns as Independent Predictors of Clinical, Metabolic, and Biochemical Behaviors Among Elite Male Athletes: The EROS-PREDICTORS Study	FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						hormonal conditioning; endocrinology of physical activity; sports endocrinology; hormones and sports; Endocrine and Metabolic Responses on Overtraining Syndrome (EROS) study; overtraining syndrome	SERUM TESTOSTERONE; HORMONAL RESPONSE; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; LOW-CARBOHYDRATE; ESTRADIOL; MEN; ENDOCRINE	Objectives:Physiological hormonal adaptions in athletes and pathological changes that occur in overtraining syndrome among athletes are unclear. The Endocrine and Metabolic Responses on Overtraining Syndrome (EROS) study evaluated 117 markers and unveiled novel hormonal and metabolic beneficial adaptive processes in athletes. The objective of the present study was to uncover which modifiable factors predict the behaviors of clinical and biochemical parameters and to understand their mechanisms and outcomes using the parameters evaluated in the EROS study. Methods:We used multivariate linear regression with 39 participants to analyze five independent variables-the modifiable parameters (caloric, carbohydrate, and protein intake, and sleep quality and duration of concurrent cognitive activity) on 37 dependent variables-that were elected among the parameters evaluated in the EROS study. Results:Carbohydrate intake predicted quick hormonal responses to stress and improved explosive responses during exercise. Protein intake predicted improved body composition and metabolism and caloric intake, regardless of the proportion of macronutrients, predicted muscle recovery, and alertness in the morning. Sleep quality predicted improved mood and excessive concurrent cognitive effort in athletes under intense training predicted impaired metabolism and libido. Conclusions:The results support the premise that eating, sleep, and social patterns modulate metabolic and hormonal function, clinical behaviors, and performance status of male athletes, and should be monitored continuously and actively to avoid dysfunctions.

To address these issues, a method of metabonomics based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to identify some crucial biomarkers and transcription levels of the enzymes in seminal fluid. Seminal fluid samples were collected from 87 AS patients and 73 healthy males with normozoospermia. The quantitative analysis by UPLC-MS/MS showed that 19 metabolites in seminal plasma were associated with AS, and they were involved in several metabolic pathways, such as energy metabolism, purine metabolism, methionine cycle, and branched chain amino acid metabolism. Among these metabolites, the levels of citric acid, malic acid, succinic acid, and pyruvic acid, which are related to energy metabolism, were collectively reduced in the AS group, whereas the lactic acid level was enhanced. These results indicated that lesser energy source (adenosine triphosphate) was produced through the anaerobic glycolysis pathway rather than via aerobic catabolism of suger and tricarboxylic acid cycle, resulting in reduced power of sperms. Meanwhile, partial least squares discriminant analysis showed significant differences in metabolic profiles between the AS and control groups. In addition, RT-qPCR results revealed that the expression levels of four genes encoding fructokinase citrate synthase, succinate dehydrogenase, and spermine synthase, which were related to energy metabolism, were decreased in the AS group. The 23 descriptors with differential expression in AS may be valuable for the diagnosis and sequential study on AS. These results will help highlight the role of sperm inactivity in AS pathogenesis.

Several metabolites may change during STEMI. Hence, analysis of metabolites in body fluid may be considered as a rapid and accurate test for initial diagnosis. This study has therefore attempted to determine the variation in metabolites identified in the serum of STEMI patients (n = 20) and 15 controls. Samples collected from the Cardiology Department, Medical Faculty, Ataturk University, were extracted by liquid-liquid extraction and analysed using liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The METLIN database was used for the identification and characterization of metabolites. According to Q-TOF/MS measurements, 231 m/z values, which were significantly different between groups (P < 0.01 and fold analysis >1.5) were detected. Metabolite identification was achieved via the Human Metabolome database. According to the multivariate data analysis, leucine, isoleucine, l-proline, l-alanine, glycine, fumaric acid, citrate, succinate and carnitine levels were decreased, whereas levels of propionic acid, maleic acid, butyric acid, urea, oleic acid, palmitic acid, lysoPC [18:2(9Z)], glycerol, phoshpatidylethanolamine, caffeine and l-lactic acid were increased in STEMI patients compared with controls. In conclusion, malonic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid and palmitic acid can be used as biomarkers for early risk stratification of patients with STEMI.

We examined that these outcomes were also observed in fermented mixed grains (FMG) containing wheat germ, wheat bran, oats, brown rice, barley, quinoa, and lentils following solid-state fermentation (SSF) by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens 245. The metabolic profile during fermentation was screened using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOF-MS). The amino acids were quantitatively measured for the validation of the changes in metabolites. The activity of enzymes (e.g., amylase, protease, and fibrinolysis) and antioxidant capacity was also assessed to elucidate the functionality of FMG. The essential amino acid contents gradually increased as fermentation progressed. As the metabolites involved in the urea cycle and polyamine pathway were changed by fermentation, arginine was used as a substance to produce citrulline, ornithine, and agmatine. FMG showed dramatic increases in enzyme activity. FMG incubated for 36 h also displayed higher total phenolic contents and free radical scavenging ability than MG. The data suggest that FMG produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens 245 possess improved nutritional and functional quality, leading to their potential use as dietary supplements.

The species has long been considered a potential source of renewable energy, an alternative for phytoremediation, and more recently, as a growth and immune stimulant. However,Chlorella vulgaris,which is one of the most studied microalga, has never been comprehensively profiled chemically. In the present study, comprehensive profiling of theChlorella vulgarismetabolome grown under normal culture conditions was carried out, employing tandem LC-MS/MS to profile the ethanolic extract and GC-MS for fatty acid analysis. The fatty acid profile ofC. vulgariswas shown to be rich in omega-6, -7, -9, and -13 fatty acids, with omega-6 being the highest, representing more than sixty percent (>60%) of the total fatty acids. This is a clear indication that this species ofChlorellacould serve as a good source of nutrition when incorporated in diets. The profile also showed that the main fatty acid composition was that of C-16-C-18(>92%), suggesting that it might be a potential candidate for biodiesel production. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed carotenoid constituents comprising violaxanthin, neoxanthin, lutein, beta-carotene, vulgaxanthin I, astaxanthin, and antheraxanthin, along with other pigments such as the chlorophylls. In addition to these, amino acids, vitamins, and simple sugars were also profiled, and through mass spectrometry-based molecular networking, 48 phospholipids were putatively identified.

Here, we conducted litter decomposition studies with Neonectria lugdunensis, a cosmopolitan aquatic fungus. Fungal isolates from four reference (non-impacted) and six metal-contaminated streams (due to mine drainage) were exposed to mine drainage and reference stream waters in Central Portugal. Impact of mine drainage waters on N. lugdunensis hyphae was investigated by performing metabolomic profiling of 200 lipids and 25 amino acids (M) with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. In parallel, functional response of N. lugdunensis isolates was assessed through expression profiles of a functional gene, cellobiohydrolase I (Cbhl). Ecological performance via leaf mass loss was also determined. Exposure to mine drainage waters altered the concentration of numerous AA and lipids. Most strikingly, a gradual increase in the concentration of the triacylglycerols (TAG) with shorter acyl chains and lesser unsaturation was observed after the exposure to mine drainage waters. In addition, the changes in the concentration of numerous TAG, lysophosphatidylcholines, and AA were more significant in the isolates from the metal-contaminated streams after exposure to mine drainage water. Cbhl gene of the isolates from reference streams was down-regulated by metal stress, while those from metal-contaminated streams remained unaffected. Finally, leaf mass loss was influenced by both exposure to mine drainage waters and the origin of isolates. Overall, our study demonstrates unique functional signatures displayed by fungi under metal stress and the relevant role that fungal AA and lipids play to cope with metal toxicity.

This study aimed to examine the effects of short- or long-term glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis on plasma metabolites and lipids of ovariectomized (OVX) sheep.MethodsTwenty-eight aged ewes were divided randomly into four groups: an OVX group, OVX in combination with glucocorticoids for two months (OVXG2), and OVX in combination with five doses of glucocorticoids (OVXG5) to induce bone loss, and a control group. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry untargeted metabolomic analysis was applied to monthly plasma samples to follow the progression of osteoporosis over five months.ResultsThe metabolite profiles revealed significant differences in the plasma metabolome of OVX sheep and OVXG when compared with the control group by univariate analysis. Nine metabolites were altered, namely 5-methoxytryptophan, valine, methionine, tryptophan, glutaric acid, 2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid, indole-3-carboxaldehyde, 5-hydroxylysine and malic acid. Similarly, fifteen lipids were perturbed from multiple lipid classes such as lysophoslipids, phospholipids and ceramides.ConclusionThis study showed that OVX and glucocorticoid interventions altered the metabolite and lipid profiles of sheep, suggesting that amino acid and lipid metabolisms are potentially the main perturbed metabolic pathways regulating bone loss in OVX sheep.

Targeted Metabolomic Profiling of Total Fatty Acids in Human Plasma by Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry	METABOLITES			English	Article						plasma fatty acids; targeted metabolomics; liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; derivatization; inborn errors of metabolism	DRIED BLOOD SPOTS; QUANTITATIVE-DETERMINATION; DERIVATIZATION; DIAGNOSIS; QUANTIFICATION	This article reports a targeted metabolomic method for total plasma fatty acids (FAs) of clinical or nutritional relevance. Thirty-six saturated, unsaturated, or branched-chain FAs with a chain length of C8-C28 were quantified using reversed-phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. FAs in plasma (10 mu L) were acid-hydrolyzed, extracted, and derivatized with DAABD-AE (4-[2-(N,N-Dimethylamino)ethylaminosulfonyl]-7-(2-aminoethylamino)-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole) at 60 degrees C for 1 h. Derivatization resulted in a staggering nine orders of magnitude higher sensitivity compared to underivatized analytes. FAs were measured by multiple-reaction monitoring using stable isotope internal standards. With physiological and pathological analyte levels in mind, linearity was established using spiked plasma. Intra-day (n = 15) and inter-day (n = 20) imprecisions expressed as variation coefficient were <= 10.2% with recovery ranging between 94.5-106.4%. Limits of detection and limit of quantitation ranged between 4.2-14.0 and 15.1-51.3 pmol per injection, respectively. Age-stratified reference intervals were established in four categories: <1 month, 1-12 month, 1-18 year, and >18 year. This method was assessed using samples from patients with disorders affecting FAs metabolism. For the first time, C28:0 and C28:0/C22:0 ratio were evaluated as novel disease biomarkers. This method can potentially be utilized in diagnosing patients with inborn errors of metabolism, chronic disease risk estimation, or nutritional applications.

Long-lived honeybee queens only mate early in maturation, and the sperm obtained from the aerial mating is stored in the spermatheca. The maintenance of sperm viability in the spermatheca is an intriguing and complex process. However, the key physiological and biochemical adaptations underlying the long-term storage of sperm remain unclear. Analysis of the metabolite profile could help better understand the biology of the spermatheca and offer insights into the breeding and conservation of honeybees and even pest control strategies. Here, the changes in metabolites in the spermatheca were quantified between virgin queens and new-laying queens (with stored sperm) via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Compared with virgin queens, changes occurred in lipids and lipid-like molecules, including fatty acyls and glycerophospholipids (GPL), prenol lipids, and sterol lipids, during storage of sperm in new-laying honeybee queens. Furthermore, the metabolic pathways that were enriched with the differentially expressed metabolites were identified and included GPL metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, and the mTOR signaling pathway. The likely roles of the pathways in the maintenance and protection of sperm are discussed. The study identifies key metabolites and pathways in the complex interplay of substances that contribute to the long-term storage of sperm and ultimately reproductive success of honeybee queens.

Serum samples were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS)-based comparative metabolomics coupled with pattern recognition methods and network pathway. In addition, the histopathology, HBV DNA detection of liver tissue, and biochemical indicators of liver function change were also explored for investigating the antiviral effect of syringin. In comparison to the model group, the metabolic profiles of the turbulence in transgenic mice tended to recover to the same as the control group after syringin therapy. A total of 33 potential biomarkers were determined to explore the metabolic disorders in the hepatitis B animal model, of which 25 were regulated by syringin, and 8 metabolic pathways, such as phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, were involved. Syringin markedly reduced the liver pathology change, inhibited HBV DNA replication, and improved liver function. Amino acid metabolism is a potential target for the treatment of hepatitis B. The hepatoprotective effect of syringin may contribute to ameliorating oxidative stress and preventing protein and DNA replication. Comparative metabolomics is a promising tool for discovering metabolic pathways and biomarkers of the hepatitis B animal model as targets to reveal the effects and mechanism of syringin, which benefits the development of natural products and advances the treatment of diseases.

However, the role and mechanisms by which prenatal cold stress affects offspring remain unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the metabolic profiles from the maternal serum and helpful in understanding the role and mechanisms by which prenatal cold stress affects the offspring. In this study, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was used to analyze serum metabolites, and PCA, PLS-DA, and OPLS-DA were performed to analyze changes in metabolites in the maternal serum after cold stress of 3 or 7 days. The results showed that 19 metabolites in the CS (cold stress 7 days)-NS (control) group and 23 metabolites in the CT (cold stress 3 days)-NT (control) group were significantly altered. These metabolites were mainly associated with unsaturated fatty acid synthesis, and arachidonic acid, linoleic acid, and glutamine and glutamate metabolism. The data indicated that prenatal cold stress not only affected the maternal neuroendocrine system, but also affected the immune system, and lipid and amino acid metabolism. These results further supported the findings of our previous studies on the effects of prenatal cold stress on the mother and offspring. A more comprehensive understanding of these data may lead to maternal intervention that can reverse the damage of prenatal stressors.

Although the genome, proteome and metabolome of homomorphic self-incompatibility (HomSI) have been investigated, metabolome findings have shown that energy deficiency is one of the factors leading to HomSI. However, the mechanism of HetSI remains unclear. This study investigates the alterations of metabolite fluxes in HetSI. Here, metabolic changes present in dimorphic styles as well as between self-incompatibility (SI) and self-compatibility (SC) pollinations ofPlumbago auriculataLam were simultaneously determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Fifty-three metabolites, mainly including other organic acids, amino acids, carbohydrates/glycosides, fatty acids/lipids, amines, amides, flavonoids and alcohols, were detected. The overall results showed that carbohydrates, which may affect pollen germination and pollen tube growth rate on stigmas, were abundant in S (short styles without pollination). Moreover, energy deficiency may not be a reason for HetSI because we found inflated levels of metabolites in SI pollinations. This study provided detailed insight into metabolic changes in HetSI and evidence for further studies of HetSI.

Orbitazine is a derivative of PAC-1 that has substituted the functional group homopiperazine ring with a piperazine ring. The purpose of this study was to assess the metabolic profile of orbitazine. Methods Metabolism was characterizedin vitroby incubating liver microsomes with metabolize orbitazine or the classical metabolic enzyme substrates. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and LC-MS/MS were used to identify the parent drugs and metabolites of orbitazine or metabolic enzyme substrates. Key findings There was no difference in metabolic stability or metabolites across different species. The metabolites included a debenzyl compound and several hydroxyl compounds, defined as M1(316), M2(440), M3(422), M4(422) and M5(422). We found that orbitazine was metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and CYP2D6 in a human liver microsomes incubation system. Orbitazine had no significant inhibitory effect on CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19 in human liver microsomes, but showed a dose-dependent inhibition of CYP2C8, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4; and there was no orbitazine-mediated induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP3A4 or mRNA expression in hepatocytes. Conclusions Thisin vitrodata on the metabolism of orbitazine may provide valuable information to support further clinical progression as a potential therapeutic molecule.

Yet, fungus-associated helper bacteria of the genus Mycetocola (Mycetocola tolaasinivorans and Mycetocola lacteus) may protect their host by an unknown detoxification mechanism. By a combination of metabolic profiling, imaging mass spectrometry, structure elucidation, and bioassays, we found that the helper bacteria inactivate tolaasin by linearizing the lipocyclopeptide. Furthermore, we found that Mycetocola spp. impair the dissemination of the pathogen by cleavage of the lactone ring of pseudodesmin. The role of pseudodesmin as a major swarming factor was corroborated by identification and inactivation of the corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster. Activity-guided fractionation of the Mycetocola proteome, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) analyses, and heterologous enzyme production identified the lactonase responsible for toxin cleavage. We revealed an antivirulence strategy in the context of a tripartite interaction that has high ecological and agricultural relevance.

Bifenthrin, a type I pyrethroid, is among the most frequently detected pyrethroids in the Bay-Delta watershed, with surface water concentrations often exceeding chronic toxicity thresholds for several invertebrate and fish species. To better understand the mechanisms of bifenthrin-induced neurotoxicity, juvenile Chinook salmon were exposed to concentrations of bifenthrin previously measured in the Delta. Non-targeted metabolomic profiles were used to identify transcriptomic changes in the brains of bifenthrin-exposed fish. Pathway analysis software predicted increased apoptotic, inflammatory, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) responses in Chinook following exposure to 0.15 and 1.50 mu g/L bifenthrin for 96 h. These responses were largely driven by reduced levels of inosine, hypoxanthine, and guanosine. Subsequently, in the brain, the expression of caspase 3, a predominant effector for apoptosis, was significantly upregulated following exposure to 1.50 mu g/L bifenthrin. This data suggests that metabolites involved in inflammatory and apoptotic responses, as well as those involved in maintaining proper neuronal function may be disrupted following sublethal exposure to bifenthrin and further suggests that additional population studies should focus on behavioral responses associated with impaired brain function.

The current diagnosis for autism relies entirely on clinical evaluation and has many limitations. In this study, we aim to elucidate the potential mechanism behind autism and establish a series of potential biomarkers for diagnosis. Here, we established an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry- (UHPLC-QTOF/MS-) based metabonomic approach to discriminate the metabolic modifications between the cohort of autism patients and the healthy subjects. UHPLC-QTOF/MS analysis revealed that 24 of the identified potential biomarkers were primarily involved in amino acid or lipid metabolism and the tryptophan kynurenine pathway. The combination of nicotinamide, anthranilic acid, D-neopterin, and 7,8-dihydroneopterin allows for discrimination between ASD patients and controls, which were validated in an independent autism case-control cohort. The results indicated that UHPLC-QTOF/MS-based metabolomics is capable of rapidly profiling autism metabolites and is a promising technique for the discovery of potential biomarkers related to autism.

Testosterone homeostasis depends on its synthesis and degradation. The major biotransformation reactions are hydroxylation by different cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms. There are no described methods to determine the profile of testosterone-hydroxylated metabolites in human urine. The aim of this study was to develop an analytical method to determine testosterone-hydroxylated metabolites in human urine using UPLC-MS. Seven testosterone-hydroxylated metabolites, androstenedione, and testosterone, were identified by comparison of their t(ret) and positive electrospray ionization (ESI+) data, with those of analytical standards. The method developed is sensitive, specific, repeatable, and precise. Limits of detection and quantization for all compounds ranged from 1.360 to 13.054 ng/ml and 4.234-39.679 ng/ml, respectively. The percentages of recovery were between 81.2 and 128.8%. The applicability of the analytical method was confirmed by analysis of urine samples obtained from two groups of healthy men (25-30 and 50-75 years old). All analyzes were identified with slightly different metabolites profiles in both groups. In conclusion, the UPLC-MS method developed here was validated for the analysis of testosterone-hydroxylated metabolites in human urine.

Among these pathologies are systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis or scleroderma, Sjogren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS), mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), and undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD). Early diagnosis is difficult due to similarity in symptoms, signs, and clinical test results. Hence, our aim was to search for differentiating metabolites of these diseases in plasma and urine samples. We performed metabolomic profiling by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) of samples from 228 SADs patients and 55 healthy volunteers. Multivariate PLS models were applied to investigate classification accuracies and identify metabolites differentiating SADs and healthy controls. Furthermore, we specifically investigated UCTD against the other SADs. PLS models were able to classify most SADs vs healthy controls (area under the roc curve (AUC) > 0.7), with the exception of MCTD and PAPS. Differentiating metabolites consisted predominantly of unsaturated fatty acids, acylglycines, acylcarnitines, and amino acids. In accordance with the difficulties in defining UCTD, the UCTD metabolome did not differentiate well from the other SADs. However, most UCTD cases were dassified as SLE, suggesting that metabolomics may provide a tool to reassess UCTD diagnosis into other conditions for more well-informed therapeutic strategies.

Botryosphaeria dieback, one of the major GTDs, is associated with wood colonization by Botryosphaeriaceae fungi, especially Neofusicoccum parvum. We used GC-MS and HPLC-MS to compare the wood metabolomic responses of the susceptible Vitis vinifera subsp. vinifera (V. v.subsp.vinifera) and the tolerant Vitis vinifera subsp. sylvestris (V. v.subsp. sylvestris) after artificial inoculation with Neofusicoccum parvum (N. parvum).N. parvum inoculation triggered major changes in both primary and specialized metabolites in the wood. In both subspecies, infection resulted in a strong decrease in sugars (fructose, glucose, sucrose), whereas sugar alcohol content (mannitol and arabitol) was enhanced. Concerning amino acids,N. parvum early infection triggered a decrease in aspartic acid, serine, and asparagine, and a strong increase in alanine and beta-alanine. A trend for more intense primary metabolism alteration was observed in V. v.subsp. sylvestris compared to V. v. subsp. vinifera. N. parvum infection also triggered major changes in stilbene and flavonoid compounds. The content in resveratrol and several resveratrol oligomers increased in the wood of both subspecies after infection. Interestingly, we found a higher induction of resveratrol oligomer (putative E-miyabenol C, vitisin C, hopeaphenol, ampelopsin C) contents after wood inoculation in V. v. subsp. sylvestris.

This plant produces secondary metabolites with biological properties of interest for the pharmaceutical industry. The objective was to determine the secondary metabolites profile of callus and cell suspension cultures of T. peruviana and compare them with those from explant (fruit pulp). Extracts in 50% aqueous ethanol and ethyl acetate were prepared. The phytochemical analysis was performed using standard chemical tests and thin layer chromatography. In addition, total phenolic and flavonoids compounds (TPC and TFC), total cardiac glycosides (TCG) and total antioxidant activity (TAA) was determined during the cell suspension growth. Phenolic chemical profile was also analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Common metabolites (alkaloids, amino acids, antioxidants, cardiac glycosides, leucoanthocyanidins, flavonoids, phenols, sugars and triterpenes) were detected in all samples. The maximum production of extracellular TCG, TPC, TFC and TAA in cells suspensions were at 6-12 days; in contrast, intracellular content was relatively constant during the exponential grown phase (0 to 12-days). HPLC analysis detected one compound with retention time at 11.6 min; this compound was tentatively identified as dihydroquercetin, a flavonoid with anti-cancer properties. These results provide evidence on the utility of the in vitro cell cultures of T. peruviana for valuable pharmaceutical compounds production.

The ABRF Metabolomics Research Group 2016 Exploratory Study: Investigation of Data Analysis Methods for Untargeted Metabolomics	METABOLITES			English	Article						metabolomics; "omics" analyses; data preprocessing		Lack of standardized applications of bioinformatics and statistical approaches for pre- and postprocessing of global metabolomic profiling data sets collected using high-resolution mass spectrometry platforms remains an inadequately addressed issue in the field. Several publications now recognize that data analysis outcome variability is caused by different data treatment approaches. Yet, there is a lack of interlaboratory reproducibility studies that have looked at the contribution of data analysis techniques toward variability/overlap of results. The goal of our study was to identify the contribution of data pre- and postprocessing methods on metabolomics analysis results. We performed urinary metabolomics from samples obtained from mice exposed to 5 Gray of external beam gamma rays and those exposed to sham irradiation (control group). The data files were made available to study participants for comparative analysis using commonly used bioinformatics and/or biostatistics approaches in their laboratories. The participants were asked to report back the top 50 metabolites/features contributing significantly to the group differences. Herein we describe the outcome of this study which suggests that data preprocessing is critical in defining the outcome of untargeted metabolomic studies.

Conservation efforts have included a captive breeding program, which has been largely unsuccessful, despite the closely related smooth marron, Cherax cainii Austin, being successfully bred for aquaculture. Using an untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomic approach we created a profile of the metabolites in the haemolymph for males and females of the two species of marron. A non-lethal method was used to collect haemolymph and 84 reproducible annotated metabolites were identified. Variation in the levels of some metabolites were detected between species and between sexes within species. Multivariate analyses clearly differentiated the congeneric species and univariate analyses identified differences between species, sex, and for some metabolite interactions, between species and sex. This study created a baseline metabolome dataset for the two species and began to investigate the biological significance of metabolites that varied between species. We have shown metabolomics could be used for targeted studies to potentially assist reproductive success. This approach will be beneficial for conservation and aquaculture practices with potential applications for other aquatic taxa worldwide. Copyright (C) 2020 by The Author(s).

Dogs are sometimes exposed to penitrem A by consumption of spoiled food waste or fallen fruit. The lipophilic toxin crosses the blood-brain barrier and targets neuroreceptors and neurotransmitter release mechanisms in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Typical symptoms of penitrem A intoxication are periodical or continuous tremors, which can be passing, persistent or lethal, depending on the absorbed dose. There is presently no information on the biotransformation and toxicokinetics of penitrem A in dogs. The aim of the present study was therefore to identify potential metabolites of the toxin by performing in vitro biotransformation assays in dog liver microsomes. Analyses by liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry led to the provisional identification of eleven penitrem A phase I metabolites, which were tentatively characterized as various oxidation products. Furthermore, elimination parameters determined in in vitro assays run under linear kinetics were used for in vitro-to-in vivo extrapolation of the toxicokinetic data, predicting a maximal bioavailability of more than 50%. The metabolite profile detected in the in vitro assays was similar to that observed in the plasma of an intoxicated dog, confirming the predictive capability of the in vitro approach.

Distinct Influence of Omega-3 Fatty Acids on the Plasma Metabolome of Healthy Older Adults	JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY SERIES A-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND MEDICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						n3-PUFA; EPA; DHA; Metabolomics; Lipoproteins	LOW-DENSITY-LIPOPROTEIN; N-3 FATTY-ACIDS; FISH-OIL SUPPLEMENTATION; CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; INSULIN; SERUM; RISK; LDL; BIOMARKERS; REDUCTION	Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3-PUFA) are well recognized for their potent triglyceride-lowering effects, but the potential influence of these bioactive lipids on other biological processes, particularly in the context of healthy aging, remains unknown. With the goal of gaining new insight into some less well-characterized biological effects of n3-PUFAs in healthy older adults, we performed metabolomics of fasting peripheral blood plasma collected from 12 young adults and 12 older adults before and after an open-label intervention of n3-PUFA (3.9 g/day, 2.7 g eicosapentaenoic [EPA], 1.2 g docosahexaenoic [DHA]). Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1-NMR) based lipoprotein subclass analysis revealed the expected reduction in total triglyceride (TG), but also demonstrated that n3-PUFA supplementation reduced very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particle number, modestly increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and shifted the composition of HDL subclasses. Further metabolite profiling by H-1-NMR and mass spectrometry revealed pronounced changes in phospholipids, cholesterol esters, diglycerides, and triglycerides following n3-PUFA supplementation. Furthermore, significant changes in hydroxyproline, kynurenine, and 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropionic acid (CMPF) following n3-PUFA supplementation provide further insight into some less well-recognized biological effects of n3-PUFA supplementation, including possible effects on protein metabolism, the kynurenine pathway, and glucose metabolism.

In the present study un-biased transcriptomics and metabolomics approaches were employed to identify and quantify individual changes in transcript and metabolite profiles in leaves of three oriental tobacco varieties. Based on next generation sequencing (NGS) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technologies, a wide variety of transcripts and metabolites was detected and the metabolic diversify among varieties was determined. Genes with largest expression differences were identified in the leaves of the three varieties; among them three were commonly over-expressed in two varieties in comparison with the third variety. Notably, significant expression differences were recorded in phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) genes that are key genes of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Following transcriptomics, meta-bolomics analysis has shown that polyphenolic compounds varied widely among the three varieties. Furthermore, statistically significant differences in soluble sugars, alcohols, organic adds, amino acids and other metabolites were also revealed. The integration of the two-omics datasets in determining diversity of tobacco varieties offers important readouts for the genetic control of metabolite production and constitutes a resource for future studies in the area of plant biotechnology for improving tobacco specific traits.

This study aimed to quantify hot water pretreatment-induced changes in metabolite profiles of sea cucumber body walls. ICP-OES, GC-MS, and LC-MS analyses of untreated- (UT-BW), hot water-treated body walls (HW-BW) of Apostichopus japonicus, and the hot water extract (HW-E) determined significant losses of minerals (25-50% w/w), protein (similar to 11% w/w), carbohydrate (33% w/w), saponins (similar to 41% w/w), and spermidine (100%), a potential antipsychotic from hot water-treated samples. Multivariate comparisons of HW-BW with UT-BW and HW-BW with HW-E showed increases in amino acids and fatty acids, suggesting hot water-induced degradation or transformation or easier extraction of protein, lipid or other components. Presence of 80 to 88.5% of compounds in the HW-E and lower DHA, EPA and glycerophospholipids levels in HW-BW suggested extraction of these metabolites. These data indicate that novel processing technologies are required to preserve the full nutritional benefits of sea cucumbers.

In the present study, we used urinary metabolic analysis in assessing diet effects on early-life metabolism. Urine samples from healthy three-month-old infants fed human milk (HM; n = 93), cow's milk-based infant formula [MF; n = 80], or soy protein-based infant formula (SF; n = 76) were analyzed with an untargeted metabolomics approach using GC-TOF MS. PLS-DA and ANOVA analyses were performed using MetaboAnalyst (v4.0). A total of 150 metabolites differed significantly among the feeding groups, including dietary-specific patterns of urinary metabolites of sugars, sugar alcohols, amino acids, and polyphenols. Urinary metabolites may mirror the infant's overall metabolism and serve as a noninvasive tool to examine the neonatal effects of diet on early-infant metabolism.

(Caryophyllaceae) is used for treatment of urinary stones and as a diuretic. Little is known about the active compounds and the mechanism of action. The phytochemical composition of H. hirsuta was comprehensively characterized using UHPLC-UV-HRMS (Ultrahigh-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Ultraviolet-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry) data. An in vitro gastrointestinal model was used to simulate biotransformation, which allowed the monitoring of the relative abundances of individual compounds over time. To analyze the longitudinal multiclass LC-MS data, XCMS, a platform that enables online metabolomics data processing and interpretation, and EDGE, a statistical method for time series data, were used to extract significant differential profiles from the raw data. An interactive Shiny app in R was used to rate the quality of the resulting features. These ratings were used to train a random forest model. The most abundant aglycone after gastrointestinal biotransformation was subjected to hepatic biotransformation using human S9 fractions. A diversity of compounds was detected, mainly saponins and flavonoids. Besides the known saponins, 15 new saponins were tentatively identified as glycosides of medicagenic acid, acetylated medicagenic acid and zanhic acid. It is suggested that metabolites of phytochemicals present in H. hirsuta, most likely saponins, are responsible for the pharmaceutical effects. It was observed that the relative abundance of saponin aglycones increased, indicating loss of sugar moieties during colonic biotransformation, with medicagenic acid as the most abundant aglycone. Hepatic biotransformation of this aglycone resulted in different metabolites formed by phase I and II reactions.

The objective of the current study was to delineate the steroidal signature of insulin resistance (IR) in obese children. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Urinary samples of 87 children (44 girls) aged 8.5-17.9 years with obesity (BMI >97th percentile) were quantified for 31 steroid metabolites by GC-MS. Defined as HOMA-IR >95th percentile and fasting glucose-to-insulin ratio >0.3, IR was diagnosed in 20 (of 87 [23%]) of the examined patients. The steroidal fingerprints of subjects with IR were compared with those of obese children without IR (non-IR). The steroidal signature of IR was created from the product of IR - non-IR for each of the 31 steroids. RESULTS IR and non-IR groups of children had comparable mean age (13.7 +/- 1.9 and 14.6 +/- 2.4 years, respectively) and z score BMI (2.7 +/- 0.5 and 2.7 +/- 0.5, respectively). The steroidal signature of IR was characterized by high adrenal androgens, glucocorticoids, and mineralocorticoid metabolites; higher 5 alpha-reductase (An/Et) (P = 0.007) and 21-hydroxylase [(THE + THF + alpha THF)/PT] activity (P = 0.006); and lower 11 beta HSD1 [(THF + alpha THF)/THE] activity (P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS The steroidal metabolomic signature of IR in obese children is characterized by enhanced secretion of steroids from all three adrenal pathways. As only the fasciculata and reticularis are stimulated by ACTH, these findings suggest that IR directly affects the adrenals. We suggest a vicious cycle model, whereby glucocorticoids induce IR, which could further stimulate steroidogenesis, even directly. We do not know whether obese children with IR and the new signature may benefit from amelioration of their hyperadrenalism.

Fermentation broth, mycelium, fruiting body and spores powder of G. lucidum were separately used in the market. However, there is no holistic insight to elucidate the molecular basis of the differentiated usage. To address this hiatus, metabolic signatures of fermentation broth, mycelium, fruiting body and spores powder were obtained by untargeted mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics approach. 9559 metabolites including polysaccharide, nucleosides, peptides, triterpenoids and alkaloids were identified. In particular, 48, 25, 364 and 28 components were peculiar to fermentation broth, mycelium, fruiting body and spores powder respectively. Most of the triterpenoids were detected predominantly in fruiting body. 15 and 9 kinds of polysaccharide, were up regulated infermentation broth and mycelium respectively. Six kinds of alkaloids were up regulated in spores powder. Furthermore, the metabolite-related models and enriched KEGG pathways of different parts of G. lucidum have been established. This study offers novelinsights into tissue-specific specialized metabolism in G. lucidum, providing a molecular basis for the unique use of different parts of G. lucidum.

Clovamide, a Hydroxycinnamic Acid Amide, Is a Resistance Factor Against Phytophthora spp. in Theobroma cacao	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						Theobroma cacao; Phytophthora; metabolomics; clovamide; hydroxycinnamic acid amide; black pod rot; polyphenol oxidase; oomycete	PERFORMANCE LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; LATENT POLYPHENOL OXIDASE; SODIUM DODECYL-SULFATE; BLACK POD DISEASE; L-AMINO ACIDS; CAFFEIC ACID; RED-CLOVER; INHIBITION-MECHANISM; COCOA; PALMIVORA	The hydroxycinnamic acid amides (HCAAs) are a diverse group of plant-specialized phenylpropanoid metabolites distributed widely in the plant kingdom and are known to be involved in tolerance to abiotic and biotic stress. The HCAA clovamide is reported in a small number of distantly related species. To explore the contribution of specialized metabolites to disease resistance in cacao (Theobroma cacao L., chocolate tree), we performed untargeted metabolomics using liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and compared the basal metabolite profiles in leaves of two cacao genotypes with contrasting levels of susceptibility to Phytophthora spp. Leaves of the tolerant genotype 'Scavina 6' ('Sca6') were found to accumulate dramatically higher levels of clovamide and several other HCAAs compared to the susceptible 'Imperial College Selection 1' ('ICS1'). Clovamide was the most abundant metabolite in 'Sca6' leaf extracts based on MS signal, and was up to 58-fold higher in 'Sca6' than in 'ICS1'. In vitro assays demonstrated that clovamide inhibits growth of three pathogens of cacao in the genus Phytophthora, is a substrate for cacao polyphenol oxidase, and is a contributor to enzymatic browning. Furthermore, clovamide inhibited proteinase and pectinase in vitro, activities associated with defense in plant-pathogen interactions. Fruit epidermal peels from both genotypes contained substantial amounts of clovamide, but two sulfated HCAAs were present at high abundance exclusively in 'Sca6' suggesting a potential functional role of these compounds. The potential to breed cacao with increased HCAAs for improved agricultural performance is discussed.

Non-Targeted Metabolomic Analysis Reveals Serum Phospholipid Alterations in Patients with Early Stages of Diabetic Foot Ulcer	BIOMARKER INSIGHTS			English	Article						Diabetic foot ulcer; type 2 diabetes mellitus; metabolomic analysis; mass spectrometry; phospholipids	MELLITUS; MARKERS; IMPACT	Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a common complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) characterized by ulcer formation, which can lead to the amputation of lower extremities. However, the metabolic alterations related to this complication are not completely elucidated. Therefore, we carried out a metabolomic analysis of serum samples obtained from T2DM adult patients diagnosed with diabetic foot ulcer in a cross-sectional, observational, and comparative study. Eighty-four volunteers were classified into the following groups: without T2DM (control group, n = 30) and with T2DM and different stages of diabetic foot ulcer according to Wagner-Meggitt classification system: DFU G0 (n = 11), DFU G1 (n = 14), DFU G2 (n = 16), and DFU G3 (n = 13). The non-target metabolomic profile followed by chemometric analysis revealed that lysophosphatidylethanolamine (16:1) could be proposed as key metabolite related to the onset of diabetic foot ulcer; however, this phospholipid was not affected by diabetic foot ulcer progression. Therefore, further studies are necessary to validate these phospholipids as biomarker candidates for the early diagnosis of diabetic foot ulcer in T2DM patients.

In our study, a rapid, swift and straightforward analytical method with the help of UHPLC-FT-ICR-MS/MS was successfully developed for the first time to separate and identify the chemical constituents of Sanhua decoction. Chromatography was performed on a Universal XB C(18)column (150 mm x 2.1 mm, 1.8 mu m) using a mobile phase containing 0.1% formic acid-water (A) and acetonitrile (B). A total of 137 compounds in Sanhua decoction were identified or tentatively characterized. The findings revealed the fact that Sanhua decoction mainly contains flavonoids (inAurantii fructus immaturusandRheum palmatumL.), anthraquinones (inRheum palmatumL.), coumarins (inNotopterygii Rhizoma Et Radix), phenylpropanoid glycosides, alkaloids and lignans (inMagnoliae Officmalis Cortex), which made up the key ingredients existing in Sanhua decoction. This study is hoped to be meaningful for the characterization of components in other traditional Chinese medicines, and lay the foundation for research on the pharmacology of Sanhua decoction.

Metabolomics is an emerging system biology method. This aim of this study was to identify abnormal metabolites and metabolic pathways associated with MA and to discover potential biomarkers that could affect the size of AAAs. Material/Methods: An untargeted metabolomic method was used to analyze the plasma metabolic profiles of 39 patients with AAAs and 30 controls. Multivariate analysis methods were used to perform differential metabolite screening and metabolic pathway analysis. Cluster analysis and univariate analysis were performed to identify potential metabolites that could affect the size of an AAA. Results: Forty-five different metabolites were identified with an orthogonal projection to latent squares-discriminant analysis model and the differences between them in the patients with AAAs and the control group were compared. A variable importance in the projection score >1 and P<0.05 were considered statistically significant. In patients with AAAs, the pathways involving metabolism of alanine, aspartate, glutamate, D-glutamine, D-glutamic acid, arginine, and proline; tricarboxylic acid cycling; and biosynthesis of arginine are abnormal. The progression of an AAA may be related to 13 metabolites: citric acid, 2-oxoglutarate, succinic acid, coenzyme Q1, pyruvic acid, sphingosine-1-phosphate, platelet-activating factor, LysoPC (16: 00), lysophosphatidylcholine (18: 2(92,122)/0: 0), arginine, D-aspartic acid, and L- and D-glutamine. Conclusions: An untargeted metabolomic analysis using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrom- etry identified metabolites that indicate disordered metabolism of energy, lipids, and amino acids in AAAs.

While MS metabolite reference libraries have been generated for metabolomics applications, mass spectra alone are unable to unambiguously identify many metabolites in a sample; these unidentified compounds are typically annotated as "features". Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is an interesting technology for metabolite identification based on vibrational spectra. However, no reports have been published that present SERS metabolite spectra from chemical libraries. In this paper, we demonstrate that an untargeted approach utilizing citrate-capped silver nanoparticles yields SERS spectra for 20% of 80 compounds chosen randomly from a commercial metabolite library. Furthermore, prescreening of the metabolites according to chemical functionality allowed for the efficient identification of samples within the library that yield distinctive SERS spectra under our experimental conditions. Last, we present a reference database of 63 metabolite SERS spectra for use as an identification tool in metabolomics studies; this set includes 30 metabolites that have not had previously published SERS spectra.

Metabolic profiling can provide an overview of metabolic reprogramming at a specific stage of tumor initiation and development. Studies about metabolic alterations related to different grades of gliomas are helpful to understand the molecular mechanism for progression of glioma. In the current study, metabolomics and lipidomics analyses based on chromatography-mass spectrometry were performed on different grades of glioma tissues. Differential metabolites between glioma and para-tumor tissues were studied and used as the basis to explore metabolic alterations related to glioma grading. It was found that short-chain acylcarnitines were elevated, whereas lysophosphatidylethanolamines (LPEs) were decreased in high-grade gliomas. Furthermore, the gene expression of short/branched-chain acyl-coenzyme dehydrogenase (ACADSB), which is involved in fatty acid oxidation, was found down-regulated with glioma progression by analyzing related genes and pathways. In addition, LPE metabolism showed a significant difference among different grades of gliomas. These important metabolic pathways related to glioma progression may provide potential clues for further study on the mechanisms and treatment of glioma.

In the present study, a new reliable and sensitive UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS method was developed to determine the permeability of amentoflavone under different conditions, and its metabolites in Caco-2 cells were identified by means of UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS method. The results showed that amentoflavone could be considered as a compound with moderate intestinal absorption in Caco-2 cell model and its absorption characteristics might be involved in paracellular passive penetration and clathrin-mediated endocytosis with no participation of efflux transporters. Eight metabolites of amentoflavone were identified in Caco-2 cell model, indicating that the main metabolic pathways were oxidation, reduction, methylation and glucuronide conjugation. This study can provide valuable evidence for an in-depth understanding of absorption mechanism and transformation of amentoflavone in the intestine. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The uptake of Cd by plants is the main entry route into the human food chain, whilst in plants it elicits oxidative stress by unbalancing the cellular redox status. Medicago sativa was subjected to chronic Cd stress for five months. Targeted and untargeted metabolic analyses were performed. Long-term Cd exposure altered the amino acid composition with levels of asparagine, histidine and proline decreasing in stems but increasing in leaves. This suggests tissue-specific metabolic stress responses, which are often not considered in environmental studies focused on leaves. In stem tissue, profiles of secondary metabolites were clearly separated between control and Cd-exposed plants. Fifty-one secondary metabolites were identified that changed significantly upon Cd exposure, of which the majority are (iso)flavonoid conjugates. Cadmium exposure stimulated the phenylpropanoid pathway that led to the accumulation of secondary metabolites in stems rather than cell wall lignification. Those metabolites are antioxidants mitigating oxidative stress and preventing cellular damage. By an adequate adjustment of its metabolic composition, M. sativa reaches a new steady state, which enables the plant to acclimate under chronic Cd stress.

Few studies to date have examined urine, the most readily available biofluid. Here we report the largest study to date using comprehensive metabolic phenotyping platforms (NMR spectroscopy and UHPLC-MS) to probe the urinary metabolome in-depth in people with Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment. Feature reduction was performed using metabolomic Quantitative Trait Loci, resulting in the list of metabolites associated with the genetic variants. This approach helps accuracy in identification of disease states and provides a route to a plausible mechanistic link to pathological processes. Using these mQTLs we built a Random Forests model, which not only correctly discriminates between people with Alzheimer's Disease and age-matched controls, but also between individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment who were later diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease and those who were not. Further annotation of top-ranking metabolic features nominated by the trained model revealed the involvement of cholesterol-derived metabolites and small-molecules that were linked to Alzheimer's pathology in previous studies.

Among theAquilaria spp., A. malaccensis is theprimary producerandis mainly found in Indonesia and Malaysia. In normal condition, agarwood is naturally formed in Aquilaria trees as a defense mechanism upon physical damage or microbial infection on the trees, which is a slow process that occurs over several years. The high demand in agarwood has spurred the development of various artificial inoculation methods where agarwood formation is synthetically induced in a shorter period of time. However, the synthetic induction method produces agarwood with aromas different fromthe naturally formed agarwood. To understand the changes in the agarwoods produced fromdifferent induction conditions, metabolite profiling of agarwood essential oil fromA. malaccensis has beenperformed. The essential oils of healthy undamaged tree trunks and, naturally formed and synthetically induced agarwoods were obtained using hydrodistillation (HS) method and analysed using gas chromatography mass spectrometer (GC-MS). These data will provide valuable resources for chemical components of agarwood produced by the species in the genus Aquilaria. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This work aimed to develop a green, simplified, and highly efficient experimental setup for extracting and tentatively identifying the broadest range of metabolites in sugarcane solid by-products collected directly within the industrial mills. Nine different extraction approaches were investigated side-by-side, including three reference methods. Based on the extraction and environmental performances assessed by two complementary metrics called Analytical-Eco Scale and the Analytical Greenness Calculator, it was possible to reach two highly efficient two liquid-phase extractions while avoiding harmful solvents and traditional time, energy, and solvent consuming sample preparation steps, such as solvent evaporation, metabolite concentration, re-suspension, and derivatization. The simultaneously produced hydroethanolic and n-heptane extracts were directly analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography, both coupled to mass spectrometry, respectively, leading to the annotation of a large dynamic range of compounds from information rich spectral data. Up to 111 metabolites were identified in a single matrix, from highly polar sucrose to nonpolar wax ester C53 in a single extraction. Orientin, apigenin-6-C-glucosylrhamnoside, 1-octacosanol, octacosanal, and other bioactive compounds were identified in these abundantly available by-products, which are currently just burned to produce energy.

Salmonella entericaOptimizes Metabolism After Addition of Acyl-Homoserine Lactone Under Anaerobic Conditions	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						quorum sensing; autoinducer; growth stage; glucose uptake; metabolic pathway	ENTERICA SEROVAR TYPHIMURIUM; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; TYPHI TSX; QUORUM; ENTERITIDIS; VIRULENCE; SDIA; BACTERIA; GROWTH; GENES	Acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) are quorum sensing (QS) signaling molecules that mediate cell-to-cell communication in Gram-negative bacteria.Salmonelladoes not produce AHL, however, it can recognize AHLs produced by other species through SdiA protein modulating important cellular functions. In this work, the influence of theN-dodecanoyl-DL-homoserine lactone (C12-HSL) on glucose consumption, metabolic profile, and gene expression ofSalmonellathroughout the cultivation time in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) under anaerobic conditions was evaluated. Analysis of the supernatant culture in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) revealed lower glucose uptake after 4 and 6 h of the addition of C12-HSL. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) based analysis of the intracellular metabolites revealed C12-HSL perturbation in the abundance levels of metabolites related to the metabolic pathways of glycerolipids, purines, amino acids, and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis. The real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) indicated thatSalmonellaincrease expression of genes associated with nucleoside degradation and quantification of metabolites supported the induction of pentose phosphate pathway to ensure growth under lower glucose consumption. The obtained data suggest an important role of C12-HSL in the optimization of metabolism at a situation of high population densities.

In the present study, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detector/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry method was developed for the metabolic profiling of human plasma after an oral administration of 40 mg anaprazole. The principal metabolic pathways were identified as sulfoxide reduction to thioether (M8-1), dehydrogenation (M21-1), sulfoxide oxidation to sulfone (M16-3), and sulfoxide reduction with O-demethylation to form carboxylic acid (M7-1). Anaprazole, M8-1, M16-3, M21-1, and M7-1 were selected and further quantified in human plasma by using a rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Anaprazole and its four metabolites were extracted from 50 of pi plasma by acetonitrile protein precipitation. Chromatographic retention and separation were achieved on an Kinetex XB-C-18 column (50 mm x 4.6 mm i.d., 5 mu m) under gradient elution using 5 mM ammonium acetate with 0.005 % ammonium hydroxide and methanol with 0.005 % ammonium hydroxide as the mobile phase. Positive electrospray ionization was performed using multiple reaction monitoring with transitions of m/z 402.2 -> 242.2, 386.2 -> 226.2, 400.2 -> 242.2, 418.2 -> 282.2, and 386.2 -> 161.2 for anaprazole, M8-1, M21-1, M16-3, and M7-1, respectively. This method was linear in the range of 5.00-3000 ng/mL for anaprazole and 1.00-600 ng/mL for the four metabolites. The lower limit of quantitation was established at 5.00 ng/mL for anaprazole and 1.00 ng/mL for the metabolites. The quantitative method was used to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of anaprazole in phase I clinical trials. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Herein, we fermented CC juice using an autochthonous isolate,Lactobacillus plantarumhaving antimicrobial effects against poultry pathogens toward formulating an antimicrobial feed additive. Following 24 h of fermentation, the antimicrobial and antiviral activities of CC juice were significantly enhanced against poultry pathogens. However, the antioxidant activity of CC juice was significantly decreased following fermentation. Meanwhile, the compositional changes of CC juice following fermentation were also investigated. The total polyphenol, thiol, and allicin contents were significantly decreased inL. plantarum24 h-fermented CC juice (LpCC) extract; however, total flavonoids increased significantly following fermentation. The untargeted metabolite profiling of nonfermented CC juice (NCC) and LpCC extracts was carried out using the ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-linear trap quadrupole-orbitrap-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap-MS/MS) followed by multivariate analyses. The score plots of principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) based on UHPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap-MS/MS datasets displayed a clear segregation between the LpCC and NCC samples, which suggests their marked metabolomic disparity. Based on the multivariate analysis, we selected 17 significantly discriminant metabolites belonging to the different chemical classes including alkaloid, flavonols, saponins, fatty acids, amino acids, and organic acids. Notably, the flavonols including the glycosides of quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin as well as the saponins displayed significantly higher relative abundance in LpCC as compared with NCC. This study provides useful insights for the development of a fermented CC juice based antimicrobial feed additive to combat poultry infections.

Fusing truncated tissue factor (tTF) with pH low insertion peptides (pHLIP), tTF-pHLIP, can target tumor vessels owing to its acidic TME and cause tumor vessel occlusion by blood clotting and subsequently effectively inhibit tumor growth. To evaluate its bioeffects, we exposed the tTF-pHLIP to normal mice and mice xenograft with B16F10 tumor and analyzed the metabolic profiling of various tissues and biofluids including plasma and urine from mice treated with and without tTF-pHLIP. A combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was employed in the study. We found that tTF-pHLIP treatment can effectively reduce tumor size and concurrently ameliorate tumor-induced alterations in the TCA cycle metabolism and lipid metabolism. In addition, we found that toxicity of tTF-pHLIP to normal mice is minor and exposure of the tTF-pHLIP induced oxidative stress to the system. Hence, we concluded that tTF-pHLIP is of low toxicity and effective in reducing tumor size as well as rebalancing tumor-induced metabolic derailment.

This is usually accompanied by severe bleeding or hemorrhage. If the soldier does not bleed to death, he may eventually succumb to complications arising from trauma hemorrhagic shock (THS). THS occurs when there is a deficiency of oxygen reaching the organs due to excessive blood loss. It can trigger massive metabolic derangements and an overwhelming inflammatory response, which can subsequently lead to the failure of organs and possibly death. A better understanding of the acute metabolic changes occurring after THS can help in the development of interventional strategies, as well as lead to the identification of potential biomarkers for rapid diagnosis of hemorrhagic shock and organ failure. In this preliminary study, a metabolomic approach using the complementary platforms of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to determine the metabolic changes occurring in a porcine model of combat trauma injury comprising of penetrating trauma to a limb with hemorrhagic shock. Several metabolites associated with the acute-phase reaction, inflammation, energy depletion, oxidative stress, and possible renal dysfunction were identified to be significantly changed after a thirty-minute shock period.

Recently, plasma purines, pyrimidines, amino acid and nicotinamide metabolites profiling attracted attention in studies on pathology and biomarkers of mental disorders but has not been adequately studied in BED. Blood and plasma samples were taken from patients with adult obese with BED (n = 20) and control adult obese without BED (n = 17). Plasma samples were analyzed for nucleotides and amino acid concentrations with high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. BED had a significantly (p < 0.05) lower uridine and hypoxanthine to creatinine ratio compared to the control group. Among the amino acids BED patients had significantly (p < 0.05) lower concentrations of glutamic acid, leucine, isoleucine and the whole branched-chain amino acids group, while the concentration of citrulline was increased. Among nicotinamide metabolites, 1-methylnicotinamide levels were significantly (p < 0.05) lower. This study highlights potential use of profiling nucleotide metabolite and amino acid pattern in BED patients that may provide information on mechanisms and potential biomarkers. However, further investigation in larger population is necessary to identify clinical correlates of the observed changes.

Thus we explored the plasma metabolome of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 to search for diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers and to improve the knowledge of metabolic disturbance in this infection. We analyzed the plasma metabolome of 55 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and 45 controls by LC-HRMS at the time of viral diagnosis (D0). We first evaluated the ability to predict the diagnosis from the metabotype at D0 in an independent population. Next, we assessed the feasibility of predicting the disease evolution at the 7th and 15th day. Plasma metabolome allowed us to generate a discriminant multivariate model to predict the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in an independent population (accuracy>74%, sensitivity, specificity>75%). We identified the role of the cytosine and tryptophan-nicotinamide pathways in this discrimination. However, metabolomic exploration modestly explained the disease evolution. Here, we present the first metabolomic study in SARS-CoV-2 patients which showed a high reliable prediction of early diagnosis. We have highlighted the role of the tryptophan-nicotinamide pathway clearly linked to inflammatory signals and microbiota, and the involvement of cytosine, previously described as a coordinator of cell metabolism in SARS-CoV-2. These findings could open new therapeutic perspectives as indirect targets.	[Blasco, H.; Lefevre, A.; Benz-de Bretagne, Isabelle; Andres, C.

JOURNAL OF PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Article						Aloe vera L; Se treatment; Metabolome; Transcriptome; Antioxidant response	BINDING SITE; ARABIDOPSIS; BIOFORTIFICATION; ANTIOXIDANT; EXPRESSION; THALIANA; GENES; RPS2	Aloe vera L. is an excellent resource for medication. Selenium-enriched aloe can act as a functional food to human health. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying selenium accumulation in Aloe vera L., we characterized the metabolic and transcriptome responses of aloe leaves under different Na2SeO4 levels (0, 200, and 400 mg/L) treatments. Aloe leaves spraying with exogenous selenium fertilizer showed a significant increase in total Se content compared with those under non-treatment control, and no distinct differences were observed between 200 and 400 mg/L Se treatment. Non-targeted metabolic profiling revealed that Se treatment triggered the accumulation of antioxidants, including amino acid and derivatives, phenols, flavonoids, terpene, as well as indole derivatives. Consistent with metabolic changes following Se treatment, the transcript level of genes involved in Se assimilation and Se-response showed dramatically increase, such as those encoding sulfate transporter, antioxidants, phytohormone signaling, transcription factors, and phenols metabolites, suggesting Se assimilation generally accompanied with antioxidant and pathogen defense. This study exhibited comprehensive insights on Se response in Aloe vera L., and provided us with targeted genes for genetic engineering, thereby improving the therapeutic value of aloe.

The analysis of the characteristics of metabolite variations in seedlings under cold stress can help understand the physiological mechanism of Anabasis aphylla when responding to stress. In this study, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry technology was used to systematically analyze the changing characteristics of the metabolite profiles of A. aphylla under cold stress. A total of 116 types of differential metabolites were stably detected, of which 41 were up-regulated, while 75 were down-regulated. The metabolites of carbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids formed the majority. The results showed that cold stress had a significant impact on the differential metabolites of A. aphylla seedlings. Via enrichment of metabolites such as gamma- aminobutyric acid, a- ketoglutaric acid, and alpha-kestose, A. aphylla could reduce the extent of damage caused by cold stress. The results of this study provide a basis for further analysis of the molecular and physiological mechanisms of the cold stress response of A. aphylla.	[Chu, G. M.; Wang, T. T.; Chang, Y.

By contrast, there is little knowledge of how metabolite alterations in individuals with diabetes relate to risk of diabetes complications and premature mortality. Metabolite profiling was performed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in 743 participants with T2DM from the population-based prospective cohorts The Malmo Diet and Cancer-Cardiovascular Cohort (MDC-CC) and The Malmo Preventive Project (MPP). During follow-up, a total of 175 new-onset cases of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 298 deaths occurred. Cox regressions were used to relate baseline levels of plasma metabolites to incident CVD and all-cause mortality. A total of 11 metabolites were significantly (false discovery rate (fdr) <0.05) associated with all-cause mortality. Acisoga, acylcarnitine C10:3, dimethylguanidino valerate, homocitrulline, N2,N2-dimethylguanosine, 1-methyladenosine and urobilin were associated with an increased risk, while hippurate, lysine, threonine and tryptophan were associated with a decreased risk. Ten out of 11 metabolites remained significantly associated after adjustments for cardiometabolic risk factors. The associations between metabolite levels and incident CVD were not as strong as for all-cause mortality, although 11 metabolites were nominally significant (p< 0.05). Further examination of the mortality-related metabolites may shed more light on the pathophysiology linking diabetes to premature mortality.

Evidence has shown that tocotrienol-rich fraction am-9 prevents myocardial injury in MI. However, the protective mechanism at the metabolite level is unknown. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were grouped into control, isoprenaline (ISO)-induced MI (MI), healthy rats receiving 200 mg/kg TRF (200TRF), and MI rats receiving 200 mg, kg TRF (200TRF+MI) groups. TRF was administered via oral gavage daily for 12 weeks followed by intraperitoneal ISO injection (85 mg/kg) for two consecutive days at a 24-hour interval to induce MI. High performance liquid chromatography was performed to analyze serum alpha-tocopherol and tocotrienol concentration whereas ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used for the untargeted metabolomic study. Serum alpha-tocopherol but not tocotrienol was increased in the 200TRF (p=0.121) and 200TRF+MI (p - =0.05) following TRF supplementation. Multivariate analysis by Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structures Discriminant Analysis showed high predictability of the group comparison models for MI vs control and 200TRF+MI vs MI (cross-validation: Q(2) =-0.7, (RY)-Y-2>0.8, p<0.05). A total of 84 and 37 metabolites [when covariance of p >=vertical bar 0.05 vertical bar (magnitude) and p(corr)>=vertical bar 0.5 vertical bar (reliability)] were significantly different in the myocardial homogenates of MI vs control and 200TRF+MI vs MI, respectively. MI rats had reduced 5-adenosylmethionine and L-cystathionine that might worsen MI by disturbing glutathione metabolism; decreased phosphoribosyl-pyrophosphate and purine salvage process that might impair DNA synthesis, and elevated glucose-6-phosphate suggesting enhanced anaerobic glycolysis possibly for rapid production of energy. Conversely TRF supplementation reversed the impaired metabolic pathways caused by MI.

Excess salinity inhibits root growth of various crops, and results in reductions of yield. It is of crucial to understand the molecular mechanisms mediating salinity stress responses for enhancing crops' salt tolerance. Marine red yeastSporobolomyces pararoseusshould have evolved some unique salt-tolerant mechanism, because they long-term live in high-salt ecosystems. However, little research has conducted so far by consideringS. pararoseusas model microorganisms to study salt-tolerant mechanisms. Here, we successfully integrated metabolomics with transcriptomic profiles ofS. pararoseusin response to salinity stress. Screening of metabolite features with untargeted metabolic profiling, we characterized 4862 compounds from the LC-MS/MS-based datasets. The integrated results showed that amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and lipid metabolism is significantly enriched in response to salt stress. Co-expression network analysis showed that 28 genes and 8 metabolites play an important role in the response ofS. pararoseus, which provides valuable clues for subsequent validation. Together, the results provide valuable information for assessing the central metabolism of mediating salt responses inS. pararoseusand offer inventories of target genes for salt tolerance improvement via genetic engineering.

This method is preferable when it is aimed to compare a large number of plant extracts for chemophenetic purposes and when it is difficult to provide equally good chromatographic separation in all of the extracts. ESI-MS shows the major compounds in fingerprinting extracts. LC-MS/MS provides identification according to fragmentation with the advantage of MS/MS, and validation can be performed in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode with simultaneous precursor and product ion scans. Herein, sixteen flavones, four flavonols, four flavanones, two lignans, three sesquiterpene lactones, and four phenolic acids, a total of thirty three substances, were identified tentatively or unambiguously from the extracts. It was concluded that ESI-MS fingerprinting is a suitable method for plant chemophenetics when coupled and validated with LC-MS/MS. Moreover, it was concluded that sesquiterpene lactones, lignans, and flavonoids are suitable for taxonomic purposes in Centaurea owing to species-specific metabolite profiles.

Highlighting predictive diet-related biomarkers would be of great public health relevance to identify at-risk subjects. The aim of this exploratory study was to select diet-related metabolites discriminating women at higher risk of breast cancer using untargeted metabolomics. Methods: Baseline plasma samples of 200 incident breast cancer cases and matched controls, from a nested case-control study within the Supplementation en Vitamines et Mineraux Antioxydants (SU.VI .MAX) cohort, were analyzed by untargeted LC-MS. Diet-related metabolites were identified by partial correlation with dietary exposures, and best predictors of breast cancer risk were then selected by Elastic Net penalized regression. The selection stability was assessed using bootstrap resampling. Results: 595 ions were selected as candidate diet-related metabolites. Fourteen of them were selected by Elastic Net regression as breast cancer risk discriminant ions. A lower level of piperine (a compound from pepper) and higher levels of acetyltributylcitrate (an alternative plasticizer to phthalates), pregnene-triol sulfate (a steroid sulfate), and 2-amino-4-cyano butanoic acid (a metabolite linked to microbiota metabolism) were observed in plasma from women who subsequently developed breast cancer. This metabolomic signature was related to several dietary exposures such as a "Western" dietary pattern and higher alcohol and coffee intakes. Conclusions: Our study suggested a diet-related plasma metabolic signature involving exogenous, steroid metabolites, and microbiota-related compounds associated with long-term breast cancer risk that should be confirmed in large-scale independent studies. Impact: These results could help to identify healthy women at higher risk of breast cancer and improve the understanding of nutrition and health relationship.

Integrative Metabolic Pathway Analysis Reveals Novel Therapeutic Targets in Osteoarthritis	MOLECULAR & CELLULAR PROTEOMICS			English	Article							MESENCHYMAL STEM-CELLS; UDP-GLUCOSE DEHYDROGENASE; SYNOVIAL-FLUID INCREASE; CHONDROGENIC DIFFERENTIATION; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; BONE-MARROW; OSTEOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION; QUANTITATIVE PROTEOMICS; N-ACETYLGLUCOSAMINE; PROLIFERATION	In osteoarthritis (OA), impairment of cartilage regeneration can be related to a defective chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Therefore, understanding the proteomic- and metabolomic-associated molecular events during the chondrogenesis of MSCs could provide alternative targets for therapeutic intervention. Here, a SILAC-based proteomic analysis identified 43 proteins related with metabolic pathways whose abundance was significantly altered during the chondrogenesis of OA human bone marrow MSCs (hBMSCs). Then, the level and distribution of metabolites was analyzed in these cells and healthy controls by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), leading to the recognition of characteristic metabolomic profiles at the early stages of differentiation. Finally, integrative pathway analysis showed that UDP-glucuronic acid synthesis and amino sugar metabolism were downregulated in OA hBMSCs during chondrogenesis compared with healthy cells. Alterations in these metabolic pathways may disturb the production of hyaluronic acid (HA) and other relevant cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) components. This work provides a novel integrative insight into the molecular alterations of osteoarthritic MSCs and potential therapeutic targets for OA drug development through the enhancement of chondrogenesis.

Inadequate understanding of the mechanisms underlying AD has hampered the development of efficient tools for definitive diagnosis and curative interventions. Previous studies have attempted to discover reliable biomarkers of AD, but these biomarkers can only be measured through invasive (neuropathological markers in cerebrospinal fluid) or expensive (positron emission tomography scanning or magnetic resonance imaging) techniques. Metabolomics is a high-throughput technology that can detect and catalog large numbers of small metabolites and may be a useful tool for characterization of AD and identification of biomarkers. In this study, we used ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry based untargeted metabolomics to measure the concentrations of plasma metabolites in a cohort of subjects with AD (n=44) and cognitively normal controls (Ctrl, n=94). The AD group showed marked reductions in levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, acyl-carnitines, degradation products of tryptophan, and elevated levels of bile acids compared to the Ctrl group. We then validated the results using an independent cohort that included subjects with AD (n=30), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n=13), healthy controls (n=43), and non-AD neurological disease controls (NDC, n=31). We identified five metabolites comprising cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, allocholic acid, indolelactic acid, and tryptophan that were able to distinguish patients with AD from both Ctrl and NDC with satisfactory sensitivity and specificity. The concentrations of these metabolites were significantly correlated with disease severity. Our results also suggested that altered bile acid profiles in AD and MCI might indicate early risk for the development of AD. These findings may allow for development of new approaches for diagnosis of AD and may provide novel insights into AD pathogenesis.

Exploring the styrene metabolism by aerobic bacterial isolates for the effective management of leachates in an aqueous system	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							PSEUDOMONAS-PUTIDA; DEGRADATION; TOLUENE; STRAIN; BIODEGRADATION; POLYSTYRENE; KINETICS; HEALTH; IDENTIFICATION; BLENDS	In the present study, the styrene metabolic profile of three aerobic bacterial isolates explored in a batch mode study. The isolates found application in the management of elachates in the waste dump yard. These three bacterial species have different origins and were studied as a single and mixed consortia. TheLysinibacillusstrain M01 (from marine sources),Lysinibacillusstrain WD03 (from a waste dump yard), andPseudomonasstrain BG07 (from bovine gut) were used in the present study. The styrene concentration was fixed in the range between 0.5 and 1.5 mL L-1. The metabolites obtained upon microbial degradation were assessed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), UV-visible spectroscopy, and FTIR spectroscopy (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy). Furthermore, the genes (Sty A,B,C,D, andE) responsible for the degradation of styrene by the three abovementioned isolates were identified using PCR with respective designed primers. Instrumental analyses revealed the presence of phenylacetic acid (PAA) at significant levels in the growth medium after the scheduled experimental period and confirmed the metabolism of styrene by the chosen isolates. Compared to the case of individual cultures, the results of the mixed consortia support the metabolism of styrene at appreciable levels. The present study provides a suitable biological solution for the management of leachates containing styrene and a way to achieve industrially important chemicals (PAA) through a microbially mediated process.

They are biosynthesised by magnetotactic bacteria (MTB), such asMagnetospirillum gryphiswaldenseMSR-1 (Mgryph). However, magnetosome bioprocessing yields low quantities compared to chemical synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles. Therefore, an understanding of the intracellular metabolites and metabolic networks related toMgryphgrowth and magnetosome formation are vital to unlock the potential of this organism to develop improved bioprocesses. In this work, we investigated the metabolism ofMgryphusing untargeted metabolomics. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was performed to profile spent medium samples ofMgryphcells grown under O-2-limited (n= 6) and O-2-rich conditions (n= 6) corresponding to magnetosome- and non-magnetosome producing cells, respectively. Multivariate, univariate and pathway enrichment analyses were conducted to identify significantly altered metabolites and pathways. Rigorous metabolite identification was carried out using authentic standards, theMgryph-specific metabolite database and MS/MS mzCloud database. PCA and OPLS-DA showed clear separation and clustering of sample groups with cross-validation values of (RX)-X-2 = 0.76, (RY)-Y-2 = 0.99 and Q(2)= 0.98 in OPLS-DA. As a result, 50 metabolites linked to 45 metabolic pathways were found to be significantly altered in the tested conditions, including: glycine, serine and threonine; butanoate; alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism; aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and; pyruvate and citric acid cycle (TCA) metabolisms. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LC-MS to characterise key metabolites inMgryphand will contribute to further understanding the metabolic mechanisms that affectMgryphgrowth and magnetosome formation.

At present, metabolite profiling based on MSI is typically performed on frozen tissue sections; however, the majority of clinical specimens need to be fixed in tissue fixative to avoid autolysis and to preserve antigenicity. In this study, we present the global impacts of different fixatives on the MS imaging of gastric cancer tissue metabolites. The MSI performances of 17 kinds of metabolites, such as amino acids, polyamines, cholines, organic acids, polypeptides, nucleotides, nucleosides, nitrogen bases, cholesterols, fatty acids, and phospholipids, in untreated, 10% formalin-, 4% paraformaldehyde-, acetone-, and 95% ethanol-fixed gastric cancer tissues were thoroughly explored for the first time. Furthermore, we also investigated the spatial expressions of 6 metabolic enzymes, namely, GLS, FASN, CHKA, PLD2, cPLA2, and EGFR, closely related to tumor-associated metabolites. Immunohistochemical staining carried out on the same tissue sections, which have undergone MSI analysis, suggests that enzymatic characterization is feasible after metabolite imaging. Combining the spatial signatures of metabolites and pathway-related metabolic enzymes in heterogeneous tumor tissues offers an insight to understand the complex tumor metabolism.

Integrative metabolic and proteomic profiling was performed on the brainstem samples of 11 week old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and age-matched normotensive Wistar rats, using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography quadrupole/time- of-flight mass spectrometry (HILIC-Q/TOFMS) (PeptideAtlas: PASS01621) and nano-liquid chromatography-high-resolution-MS (nano-LC-high-resolution) combined with quantitative tandem mass tags (ProteomeXchange: PXD021210). The results showed a potentially significant measure of metabolic disorders in the brainstem of SHRs, including purine and pyrimidine metabolism and carnitine and acylcarnitine deficiency. By integrating the differential metabolites (VIP > 1 and p < 0.1) with the differentially expressed proteins (>1.2-fold and p < 0.05), the results revealed aberrant insulin signaling in the brainstem of SHRs, including reduced carnitine and acetylcarnitine; increased arginine; and increased flotillin-1 (FLOT1), hemoglobin subunit alpha-1/2, and hemoglobin subunit beta-2 proteins verified by the parallel reaction monitoring analysis (PeptideAtlas: PASS01622). The aberrant insulin signaling pathway in the brainstem of SHRs might help explain the correlation between essential hypertension and insulin resistance. These findings on the brainstem of SHRs could provide new insights into the dysregulation of the central nervous system in hypertension, especially as it relates to metabolite and protein levels.

Their metabolic profiles were studiedviaHPLC-PDA-ESI-MS/MS and afforded a tentative characterization of 98 compounds, including free organic acids, phenolic acid derivatives, flavonoid aglycones, flavonoid glycosides, flavonoids containing 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaroyl (HMG) units, coumarin derivatives and limonoids. Column chromatography resulted in isolation of six metabolites for the first time that were identified as nobiletin (C1), isosinensetin (C2), limonin (C3), 4 '-demethylnobiletin (C4), stigmasterol-O-glucoside (C5) and hesperidin (C6).In vitrostudies of the anti-inflammatory activity of DCM-L against cyclooxygenases (COXs) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) enzymes revealed that DCM-L showed higher activity than the other tested fractions. Thein vivogastroprotective effects of that fraction were evaluated using alcohol-induced gastric ulcers in rats. The obtained findings validated the gastroprotective and anti-ulcerogenic activities of DCM-L through its anxiolytic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects. Therefore, we recommend the use of Murcott mandarin leaves as a part of a protection strategy for gastric ulcer.

This study aimed to explore the effects of casein, pork, and chicken proteins at different protein levels (40% E vs 20% E) on body weight regulation, body fat accumulation, serum hormone levels, and inflammatory factors/metabolites in rats maintained on high-fat (45% E fat) diets for 84 d. Increased protein levels resulted in a significant reduction in body fat mass and an increase in the serum levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, independent of protein source. Analysis of blood via untargeted metabolomics analysis identified eight, four, and four metabolites significantly altered by protein level, protein source, and a protein level-source interaction, respectively. Together, the effects of casein, chicken, and pork protein on the regulation of body fat accumulation and blood metabolite profile are largely dependent on protein level and less attributable to the protein source.

Sixty-four metabolites, which covered a broad spectrum of polar (e.g. amino acids, sugars, acids and phenolic compounds) and non-polar (e.g. fatty acid methyl esters, free fatty acids, sterols) buckwheat constituents with low molecular weights, were identified and quantified. Results show that content of polar metabolites, such as sugars and amino acids, increased during malting. Meanwhile, levels of most of non-pollar metabolites, including fatty acid methyl esters, free fatty acids and sterols changed very little or kept constant. The statistical assessment of the metabolic data was derived by principal component analysis (PCA). Results demonstrate that the metabolic changes during the buckwheat malting process can be reflected by time-dependent shifts in the PCA loading scores. The analysis of the loadings further showed that polar metabolites, including sugars, amino acids and some of phenolic acid compounds, were the major contributors of the malting time-driven changes during buckwheat malting. The changing rule of these metabolites was explored nutritionally. Free fatty acids were the superior energy supplier during steeping and initial germination phase compared with sugars in the buckwheat malting process. Buckwheat malt is a potential material for the beer brewing industry.

Several deflazacort metabolites were isolated and identified from rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans. Among them, 1ss,2ss-epoxy-3ss-hydroxy-21-desacetyl deflazacort, referred to as Metabolite V, was reported to be one of the major circulating metabolites in humans. However, its quantitative distribution in plasma was not fully characterized. The objective of this study was to determine deflazacort plasma pharmacokinetics, metabolite profiles and their quantitative exposures in humans following a single oral dose. Six healthy male subjects were each administered a single oral dose of 60 mg [C-14]-deflazacort. Plasma and urine were collected and deflazacort metabolites in plasma were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography radio-profiling followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry characterization. Metabolite V was isolated from urine and its structure was further confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. These analyses demonstrated that deflazacort was not detectable in plasma; of the eight circulating deflazacort metabolites identified or characterized, the pharmacologically active metabolite 21-desacetyl deflazacort and inactive metabolite 6ss-hydroxy-21-desacetyl deflazacort accounted for 25.0% and 32.9% of the 0-24 hours plasma total radioactivity, respectively, while Metabolite V, an epoxide species, was a minor circulating metabolite, representing only about 4.7% of the total plasma radioactivity.

However, leading metabolomics technologies, such as NMR and mass spectrometry (MS), access only a small portion of the metabolome. Now an approach is presented that uses the high sensitivity and chemical specificity of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for online detection of metabolites from tumor lysates following liquid chromatography (LC). The results demonstrate that this LC-SERS approach has metabolite detection capabilities comparable to the state-of-art LC-MS but suggest a selectivity for the detection of a different subset of metabolites. Analysis of replicate LC-SERS experiments exhibit reproducible metabolite patterns that can be converted into barcodes, which can differentiate different tumor models. Our work demonstrates the potential of LC-SERS technology for metabolomics-based diagnosis and treatment of cancer.

However, the quality control (QC) standards of SJZD are insufficient. Chinmedomics has been designed to discover and verify bioactive compounds of a variety of formula rapidly. In this study, we used Chinmedomics to evaluate the SJZD's efficacy against SQDS to discover the potential quality-markers (q-markers) for QC. A total of 56 compounds in SJZD were characterizedin vitro, and 23 compounds were discoveredin vivo. A total of 58 biomarkers were related to SQDS, and SJZD can adjust a large proportion of marker metabolites to normal level and then regulate the metabolic profile to the health status. A total of 10 constituents were absorbed as effective ingredients that were associated with overall efficacy. We preliminarily determined malonyl-ginsenoside Rb2 and ginsenoside Ro as the q-markers of ginseng; dehydrotumulosic acid and dihydroxy lanostene-triene-21-acid as the q-markers of poria; glycyrrhizic acid, isoglabrolide, and glycyrrhetnic acid as the q-markers of licorice; and 2-atractylenolide as the q-marker of macrocephala. According to the discovery of the SJZD q-markers, we can establish the quality standard that is related to efficacy.

In India, AYUSH systems of medicine have been promoted as an immune-protection strategy. Andrographis paniculata (Burm. F) Nees (AP) mentioned in Ayurveda has been widely used for treating sore throat, flu, and upper respiratory tract infections which may provide possible novel therapeutic approaches, exclusively targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its pathways. Objectives The present work uses liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) metabolomics and combination synergy analysis based on network pharmacology to mine multimode evidence to understand the possible mechanism of action, diseases association, protein-protein interaction and major pathways involved therein. Material and methods Metabolite profiling was performed by Agilent QTOF LC-MS/MS system. Network pharmacology analysis was performed by using functional annotation analysis based on databases like Binding DB, STRING, DAVID and KEGG for further data mining. Further combination synergy was evaluated using "neighbourhood approach" and networks were constructed through Cytoscape 3.2.1. Results The molecules from kalmegh provides immune-protection and anti-viral response via involving different pathways, like toll-like receptor pathway, PI3/AKT pathway and MAP kinase pathways against COVID-19 infection. The KEGG analysis showed that in a vast majority of the most enriched pathways, AP were associated with viral infections and upper respiratory tract infections. Conclusions The results suggest a synergy between andrographolide and other molecules identified as safe and efficacious anti-inflammatory agent having effects on upper respiratory tract infections and can significantly decrease the production of cytokines and pro-inflammatory factors in viral infections.

Extended-criteria donor livers could be used to expand the donor pool but are prone to ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and post-transplant graft dysfunction. Ex situ machine perfusion may be used as a platform to rehabilitate discarded or extended-criteria livers prior to transplantation, though there is a lack of data guiding the utilization of different perfusion modalities and therapeutics. Since amino acid derivatives involved in inflammatory and antioxidant pathways are critical in IRI, we analyzed differences in amino acid metabolism in seven discarded non-steatotic human livers during normothermic- (NMP) and subnormothermic-machine perfusion (SNMP) using data from untargeted metabolomic profiling. We found notable differences in tryptophan, histamine, and glutathione metabolism. Greater tryptophan metabolism via the kynurenine pathway during NMP was indicated by significantly higher kynurenine and kynurenate tissue concentrations compared to pre-perfusion levels. Livers undergoing SNMP demonstrated impaired glutathione synthesis indicated by depletion of reduced and oxidized glutathione tissue concentrations. Notably, ATP and energy charge ratios were greater in livers during SNMP compared to NMP. Given these findings, several targeted therapeutic interventions are proposed to mitigate IRI during liver machine perfusion and optimize marginal liver grafts during SNMP and NMP.

Liquiritigenin and liquiritin, two kinds of major flavonoes in licorice, are effective substances used as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and tumor-suppressive food, cosmetics or medicines. However, their in vivo metabolites have not been fully explored. Aim of study: To clarify the metabolism of liquiritigenin and liquiritin in mice. Materials and methods: In this study, we developed a liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole/time-offlight mass spectrometry approach to determine the metabolites in mice plasma, bile, urine and feces after oral administration of liquiritigenin or liquiritin. The structures of those metabolites were tentatively identified according to their fragment pathways, accurate masses, characteristic product ions, metabolism laws or reference standard matching. Results: A total of 26 and 24 metabolites of liquiritigenin or liquiritin were respectively identified. The products related with apigenin, luteolin or quercetin were the major metabolites of liquiritigenin or liquiritin in mice. Seven main metabolic pathways including (de)hydrogenation, (de)hydroxylation, (de)glycosylation, (de)methoxylation, acetylation, glucuronidation and sulfation were summarized to tentatively explain their bio-transformation. Conclusion: This study not only can provide the evidence for in vivo metabolites and pharmacokinetic mechanism of liquiritigenin and liquiritin, but also may lay the foundation for further development and utilization of liquiritigenin, liquiritin and then licorice.

Studies in white and Japanese populations suggested that gender and age can affect circulating plasma metabolite profiles; however, the metabolomics characteristics in Chinese population has not been surveyed. In our study, we applied liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based approach to analyze Chinese plasma metabolome and lipidome in a cohort of 534 healthy adults (aging from 15 to 79). Fatty-acid metabolism was found to be gender- and age-dependent in Chinese, similar with metabolomics characteristics in Japanese and white populations. Differently, lipids, such as TGs and DGs, were found to be gender-independent in Chinese population. Moreover, nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism was found to be specifically age-related in Chinese. The application of plasma metabolome and lipidome for renal cell carcinoma diagnosis (143 RCC patients and 34 benign kidney tumor patients) showed good accuracy, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.971 for distinction from healthy control, and 0.839 for distinction from the benign. Bile acid metabolism was found to be related to RCC probably combination with intestinal microflora. Definition of the variation and characteristics of Chinese normal plasma metabolome and lipidome might provide a basis for disease biomarker analysis.

Chemical and pharmacological evaluation of the non-flowering aerial parts of Acacia modesta Wall. cultivated in Egypt	FUTURE JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Acacia; Anti-hyperglycemic; Flavone; Hepato-protective; Saponin	PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; ESI-MS/MS; IDENTIFICATION; ANTIOXIDANT; MS; FLAVONES	Background: Acacia modesta Wall. (A. modesta), often recognized as Phulai, is belonging to family Fabaceae and sub-family Mimosaceae. A. modesta has many beneficial uses. Leaves, wood, flowers, and gum of A. modesta have been used frequently for multiple therapeutic purposes. Results: The chemical investigation of butanol fraction of A. modesta non-flowering aerial parts yielded Vitexin-2 ''-beta-D-glucopyranoside and Apigenin-6,8-di-C-beta-D-glucopyranoside in a flavone mixture as well as (beta-D-glucopyranosyl (1-3)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-3-beta-hydroxy-11-oxo-olean-12-en-28-oic acid) an oleanane-type triterpenoidal saponin. Metabolite profiling via ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS) of the ethyl acetate fraction resulted in recognizing of eighteen compounds tentatively compared with previously published data. Quantitative measurement of the overall value of flavonoids of A. modesta was found to be 2.824 mu g/100 mu g +/- 0.01 calculated as quercetin. The acute toxicity study of the ethanol extract proved that the plant under investigation is safe and nontoxic to the male albino mice used. The anti-hyperglycemic activity of the ethanol extract performed on type 2 diabetic rats proved that the most potent dosage was 200 mg/kg b. wt. after 4 and 4 weeks of treatment respectively compared to metformin. Furthermore, evaluation of the hepato-protective activity of the ethanol extract of the plant under investigation showed that the most potent extract was with a dose level of 200 mg/kg b. wt. after 3 and 10 days of continuous treatment compared to silymarin. Conclusion: It can be concluded that A. modesta Wall. cultivated in Egypt could be used as a promising anti-diabetic agent and a hepato-protective agent against hepatocellular damage induced by hepatotoxins.

The investigation of gastrointestinal and hepatic biotransformation can be facilitated by in vitro screening methods. This study compares two widely used in vitro models for hepatic biotransformation: 1) human S9 fractions and 2) human liver microsomes and cytosolic fractions in a two-step sequence, with the purpose of identifying differences in the biotransformation of medicagenic acid, the putative precursor of active metabolites, responsible for the medicinal effects of the herb Herniaria hirsuta. The combination of liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry with subsequent suspect and non-target data analysis allowed the identification of thirteen biotransformation products, four of which are reported here for the first time. Eight biotransformation products resulting from oxidative Phase I reactions were identified. Phase II conjugation reactions resulted in the formation of three glucuronidated and two sulfated biotransformation products. No major differences could be observed between incubations with human liver S9 or when utilizing human microsomal and cytosolic fractions. Apart from two metabolites, both methods rendered the same qualitative metabolic profile, with minor quantitative differences. As a result, both protocols applied in this study can be used to study in vitro human liver biotransformation reactions.

Part 1: A study of metabolic profiles in vivo and in vitro by high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry	BIOMEDICAL CHROMATOGRAPHY			English	Article						HPLC-Q-TOF; intestinal bacteria; liver; metabolism; Qushi Huayu Fang	FATTY LIVER-DISEASE; RATS; MODEL; ACID; CONSTITUENTS; EXPRESSION; PATHWAY; PLASMA; EMODIN; MS/MS	Qushi Huayu Fang (QHF) is a clinic-empirical prescription for treating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in China, which is composed of five herbs. However, the bioactive constituents responsible for the efficacy of QHF remain unclear. Thus, a high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry method was established and adopted to identify the constituents of QHF, and profile its metabolism in vivo and in vitro. Among the 66 constituents in QHF, only 14 compounds of six structural types were absorbed, and 34 metabolites were generated through eight metabolic pathways. A total of 20 metabolites were first reported, including four organic acids, one iridoid, two flavones, five naphthols, three anthraquinones, and five stilbenes. Glucuronidation and sulfation were the main metabolic pathways, and the intestinal metabolism played an important role in the biotransformation of QHF. Many compounds, especially those detected in the liver, the target organ of QHF, were reported to display the anti-NAFLD activity. This is the first study to explore the constituents of QHF and its metabolism in vivo and in vitro, thus realizing the first step to clarify the chemical basis of QHF qualitatively, and laying the foundation for further research on the anti-NAFLD mechanism of QHF.

However, the components and efficacy of different PF varieties remain underexplored so far. In the present work, a nontargeted rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with quadruple-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (RRLC-Q/TOF-MS)-based metabolomics approach was developed to investigate the difference in the chemical compositions between green PF and purple PF. A total of 71 compounds were identified or tentatively identified, among which 7 phenolic acids, 10 flavonoids, and 9 anthocyanins were characterized as differential metabolites. In addition, heatmap visualization and ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-TQMS/MS)-based quantitative analysis revealed that flavonoids and anthocyanins especially had higher contents in purple PF. Furthermore, the anti-oxidative activities of two varietal PFs were evaluated in vivo zebrafish and in vitro human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The results showed that the purple PF had more pronounced anti-oxidative activities than did the green PF, which may be due to the presence of anthocyanins and a higher concentration of flavonoids in its phytochemical profile. The outcome of the present study is expected to provide useful insight on the comprehensive utilization of a PF resource.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to discover a highly effective drug for PMOP treatment. In this study, ultra-high performance liquid tandem quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q/TOF-MS) was used to analyze the urine metabolic profiling and potential biomarkers, the relevant metabolic network of PMOP rats, and further to evaluate the intervention effect of Eleutheroside E (EE) against PMOP. Using multivariate statistical analysis combined with UPLC-Q/TOF-MS, a total of 27 biomarkers were identified, which related with 16 metabolic pathways, mainly involving steroidogenesis, beta oxidation of very long chain fatty acids, glutathione metabolism, carnitine synthesis, estrone metabolism, oxidation of branched chain fatty acids, etc. After treatment of EE, these biomarkers were markedly regulated, mainly involving steroid hormone biosynthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism, primary bile acid biosynthesis, indicating that EE had the therapeutic effect on PMOP. This study identified the potential urine metabolic markers and related metabolic pathways of the PMOP, explained the metabolic effect and pharmacological mechanisms of EE against PMOP, and provided a basis for the pharmacological study of EE.

There is a recognized need to clarify the biological pathways through which MDPV elicits general and target-organ toxicity. In this work, a comprehensive untargeted GC-MS-based metabolomics analysis was performed, aiming to detect metabolic changes in putative target organs (brain, heart, kidneys and liver) but also in urine of mice after acute exposure to human-relevant doses of MDPV. Male CD-1 mice received binge intraperitoneal administrations of saline or MDPV (2.5 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg) every 2 h, for a total of three injections. Twenty-four hours after the first administration, target organs, urine and blood samples were collected for metabolomics, biochemical and histological analysis. Hepatic and renal tissues of MDPV-treated mice showed moderate histopathological changes but no significant differences were found in plasma and tissue biochemical markers of organ injury. In contrast, the multivariate analysis significantly discriminated the organs and urine of MDPV-treated mice from the control (except for the lowest dose in the brain), allowing the identification of a panoply of metabolites. Those levels were significantly deviated in relation to physiological conditions and showed an organ specific response towards the drug. Kidneys and liver showed the greatest metabolic changes. Metabolites related with energetic metabolism, antioxidant defenses and inflammatory response were significantly changed in the liver of MDPV-dosed animals, while the kidneys seem to have developed an adaptive response against oxidative stress caused by MDPV. On the other hand, the dysregulation of metabolites that contribute to metabolic acidosis was also observed in this organ. The heart showed an increase of fatty acid biosynthesis, possibly as an adaptation to maintain the cardiac energy homeostasis. In the brain, changes in 3-hydroxybutyric acid levels may reflect the activation of a neurotoxic pathway. However, the increase in metabolites with neuroprotective properties seems to counteract this change. Metabolic profiling of urine from MDPV-treated mice suggested that glutathione-dependent antioxidant pathways may be particularly involved in the compensatory mechanism to counteract oxidative stress induced by MDPV. Overall, this study reports, for the first time, the metabolic profile of liver, kidneys, heart, brain, and urine of MDPV-dosed mice, providing unique insights into the biological pathways of toxicity. Our findings also underline the value of toxicometabolomics as a robust and sensitive tool for detecting adaptive/toxic cellular responses upon exposure to a physiologically relevant dose of a toxic agent, earlier than conventional toxicity tests.

Integration of metabolomics and transcriptomics reveals novel biomarkers in the blood for tuberculosis diagnosis in children	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; INTRATHORACIC TUBERCULOSIS; PEDIATRIC TUBERCULOSIS; PLASMA; ACID; CLASSIFICATION; INFECTION; PACKAGE; UTILITY	Pediatric tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health problem. Improved pediatric diagnostics using readily available biosources are urgently needed. We used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to analyze plasma metabolite profiles of Indian children with active TB (n=16) and age- and sex-matched, Mycobacterium tuberculosis-exposed but uninfected household contacts (n=32). Metabolomic data were integrated with whole blood transcriptomic data for each participant at diagnosis and throughout treatment for drug-susceptible TB. A decision tree algorithm identified 3 metabolites that correctly identified TB status at distinct times during treatment. N-acetylneuraminate achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.66 at diagnosis. Quinolinate achieved an AUC of 0.77 after 1 month of treatment, and pyridoxate achieved an AUC of 0.87 after successful treatment completion. A set of 4 metabolites (gamma-glutamylalanine, gamma-glutamylglycine, glutamine, and pyridoxate) identified treatment response with an AUC of 0.86. Pathway enrichment analyses of these metabolites and corresponding transcriptional data correlated N-acetylneuraminate with immunoregulatory interactions between lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells, and correlated pyridoxate with p53-regulated metabolic genes and mitochondrial translation. Our findings shed new light on metabolic dysregulation in children with TB and pave the way for new diagnostic and treatment response markers in pediatric TB.

In this preliminary study, untargeted metabolomics with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF) coupled with both unsupervised and supervised multivariate statistics was used to investigate the chemical profile of bulk milk collected from dairy cows (n = 103) following different feeding regimens, being corn silage (MS-FS, n = 51), hay (H-FS, n = 35) and a mixed ration consisted in fresh forage and hay (MR-FS, n = 17). Overall, a total of 1686 metabolites was identified by means of UHPLC-QTOF, with significant differences (p < 0.05) between the three feeding regimens under investigation. The metabolites detected mainly belonged to lipids (mainly glycerophospholipids and triglycerides), followed by oligopeptides, steroid derivatives, and secondary metabolites (such as phenolic compounds and terpenoids). Interestingly, multivariate statistics applied to the metabolomics data revealed intriguing differences in the discriminant markers detected. The markers identified included both feed-derived (such as phenolic metabolites) but also animal-derived compounds (such as fatty acids). Therefore, our results provide comprehensive insights into the metabolomics profile of different bulk milk samples, suggesting also an indirect influence of feeding regimens on its chemical signature.

In this study, we developed a large-scale targeted metabolomics method and expanded its applicability to various human samples. This approach initially involved unbiased identification of metabolites in human cells, tissues and body fluids using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS). Targeted metabolomics method was established with utility of UHPLC-triple quadrupole MS, which enables targeted profiling of over 400 biologically important metabolites (e.g., amino acids, sugars, nucleotides, dipeptides, coenzymes, and fatty acids), covering 92 metabolic pathways (e.g., Krebs cycle, glycolysis, amino acids metabolism, ammonia recycling, and one-carbon metabolism). The present method displayed better sensitivity, repeatability and linearity than the Orbitrap MS-based untargeted metabolomics approach and demonstrated excellent performance in lung cancer biomarker discovery, in which 107 differential metabolites were able to discriminate between carcinoma and adjacent normal tissues, implicating the Warburg effect, alteration of redox state, and nucleotide metabolism of lung cancer. This new method is flexible and expandable and offers many advantages for metabolomics analysis, such as wide metabolite coverage, good repeatability and linearity and excellent capability in biomarker discovery, making it useful for both basic and clinical metabolic research.

Obtained hydrolyzates were characterized by sensory analysis, gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Five different aroma categories emerged. Garnacha may develop specific tropical/citrus fruit, kerosene and floral and Tempranillo toasty-woody and red-fruit characteristics. Those notes seem to mask alcoholic and fruit-in-syrup descriptors and the common vegetal background. Twenty-seven odorants were detected by GC-O. GC-MS data showed a clustering closely matching the one found by sensory analysis, suggesting the existence of five specific metabolomic profiles behind the five specific sensory profiles. Overall results suggest that 3-mercaptohexanol is responsible for tropical/citrus fruit, TDN for kerosene, volatile phenols for woody/toasty, beta-damascenone and massoia lactone, likely with Z-1,5-octadien-3-one for fruit-in-syrup and alcoholic notes. Nine lipid-derived unsaturated aldehydes and ketones may be responsible for the vegetal background.

In this study, we present the structural elucidation of six, not described yet, metabolites of an antipsychotic molecule: molindone. The elucidation of metabolites was supported with a novel photocatalytical approach with the use of WO3 and WS2 assisted photochemical reactions. An UHPLC-ESI-Q-TOF combined system was used for the registration of all obtained metabolite profiles as well as to record the high resolution fragmentation spectra of the observed transformation products. As a reference in the in vitro metabolism simulation method, the incubation with human liver microsomes was used. Chemometric comparison of the obtained profiles pointed out the use of the WO3 approach as being more convenient in the field of drug metabolism studies. Moreover, the photocatalysis was used in the direction of the main drug metabolite synthesis in order to further isolation and characterization.

This study investigated the protective role of ABM fruiting body against streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. After 4 weeks of ABM supplement, glucose homeostasis was improved in diabetic rats. Quantitative real-time and Western blot analyses suggested that ABM could promote the gene and protein expression level of insulin receptor, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, phospho-kinase B, kinase B, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, insulin receptor substrate 1, glucose transporter-4, and glutamine synthetase, while inhibiting the expression of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta and c-jun N-terminal kinase 1 and 2. According to multivariate and univariate statistical analysis, liver metabolite profiles of the normal and diabetic rats fed basal and experimental diet were clearly separated. The differential liver metabolites from diabetic rats fed basal and ABM diet-related pathways including the glycolysis pathway, pentose phosphate pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation were analyzed. A total of 18 potential biomarker metabolites were identified as differential biomarkers associated with ABM supplement diet.

However, investigations of differentCentaurea calcitrapaL. extracts in terms of cytotoxicity and antimicrobial activity against phytopathogens are generally scarce. The phenolic profile and broad antimicrobial activity (especially towards bacterial phytopathogens) of methanol (MeOH), 70% ethanol (EtOH), ethyl-acetate (EtOAc), 50% acetone (Me2CO) and dichloromethane: methanol (DCM: MeOH, 1: 1) extracts ofC. calcitrapaleaves and their potential toxicity on MRC-5 cell line were investigated for the first time. A total of 55 phenolic compounds were identified: 30 phenolic acids and their derivatives, 25 flavonoid glycosides and aglycones. This is also the first report of the presence of centaureidin, jaceidin, kaempferide, nepetin, flavonoid glycosides, phenolic acids and their esters inC. calcitrapaextracts. The best results were obtained with EtOAc extract with lowest MIC values expressed in mu g/mL ranging from 13 to 25, while methicillin resistantStaphylococcus aureuswas the most susceptible strain. The most susceptible phytopathogens werePseudomonas syringaepv.syringae,Xanthomonas campestrispv.campestrisandAgrobacterium tumefaciens. The highest cytotoxicity was recorded for EtOAc and Me2CO extracts with the lowest relative and absolute IC(50)values between 88 and 102 mu g/mL, while EtOH extract was the least toxic with predicted relative IC(50)value of 1578 mu g/mL. Our results indicate that all tested extracts at concentration considered as non-toxic can be one of great importance in combat towards phytopathogenic and human pathogenic strains, as well as natural sources of antimicrobials.

However, under high aqueous separation conditions, corona discharge is frequently observed at emitter tips, which may result in low ion abundances and reduced nano-ESI needle emitter lifetimes. In this work, we introduce a sheathless CE-MS method for the highly efficient and sensitive analysis of nucleotides employing ESI in positive ion mode, thereby fully circumventing corona discharge. By using a background electrolyte of 16 mM ammonium acetate (pH 9.7) a mixture of 12 nucleotides, composed of mono-, di-, and tri-phosphates, could be efficiently analyzed with plate numbers per meter above 220 000 and with LODs in the range from 0.06 to 1.3 nM, corresponding to 0.4 to 8.6 attomole, when using an injection volume of about 6.5 nL only. The utility of the method was demonstrated for the profiling of nucleotides in low numbers of mammalian cells using HepG2 cells as a model system. Endogenous nucleotides could be efficiently analyzed in extracts from 50 000 down to 500 HepG2 cells only. Moreover, apart from nucleotides, also some nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotides and amino acids could be analyzed under these conditions, thereby clearly illustrating the utility of this approach for metabolic profiling of low amounts of biological material.

However, whether PMFs in citrus fruit alter human gut microbiota is not well understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of PMF-rich fraction from Ougan (Citrus reticulata cv. Suavissima) on gut microbiota and evaluate the intestinal metabolic profile of PMFs in Institute of Cancer Research mice. The main components of the PMF-rich fraction were nobiletin, tangeretin, and 5-demethylnobiletin. The composition of the gut microbiota was analyzed using 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing. The results showed that after oral administration, the composition of mice gut microbiota was significantly altered. The relative abundance of two probiotics, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, were found to increase significantly. A total of 21 metabolites of PMFs were detected in mice intestinal content by high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, and they were generated through demethylation, demethoxylation, hydroxylation, and glucuronidation. Our results provided evidence that PMFs have potential beneficial regulatory effects on gut microbiota that in turn metabolize PMFs, which warrants further investigation in human clinical trials.

Objective In the quest for new sources of biologically-active compounds, we intended in the present work to undertake a comprehensive characterisation of phytochemical compounds fromRumex algeriensisflowers and stems hydro-methanolic extract. Methodology Chemical profiles were evaluated by a rapid analytical method reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) coupled to electrospray ionisation-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-QTOF-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using negative and positive ions modes. Results In this work, 44 bioactive compounds were tentatively identified using high mass accuracy data and confirmed by MS/MS experiments, among which five compounds were reported for the first time in the Polygonaceae family. These compounds were classified as sugars, hydroxybenzoic acids, hydroxycinnamic acids, flavonols, flavanones, flavone, flavanols, condensed tannins, hydrolysable tannins and their conjugated derivatives. Conclusions The obtained results highlighted thatRumex algeriensis, even though undervalued and unexplored, contributes to the preclinical knowledge that could be considered as a renewable source of nutraceutical compounds that may be exploited in novel herbal medicinal products, in the food, pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries.

Gibberellic Acid Induces Unique Molecular Responses in 'Thompson Seedless' Grapes as Revealed by Non-targeted Metabolomics	JOURNAL OF PLANT GROWTH REGULATION			English	Article						Sultana grapes; Untargeted metabolomics; GA(3) response; GA(3) signaling; Biosynthetic pathways	PROLINE LEVELS; ABSCISIC-ACID; GROWTH; STRESS; PLANT; METABOLISM; FRUITS; GA(3); SIZE	Compact clusters and small berry size are the major problems associated with the commercialization of table grapes. The application of gibberellic acid 3 (GA(3)) has been a long-followed practice to overcome these issues. To analyze the molecular response of 'Thompson Seedless' grapes to GA(3) treatment, we investigated the metabolomes of its rachises, clusters, and berries, 6 h and 24 h after the treatment. Metabolite profiling using non-targeted metabolomics approach revealed several metabolites, including arginine, proline, tyrosine, kaempferol, resveratrol, catechin, and so on as possible biomarkers of GA(3) treatment in grapes. GA(3) treatment greatly impacted the alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism pathways, and the GA(3)-mediated alterations in the levels of certain plant growth regulators and primary metabolites were in accordance with important growth and developmental processes in grapes. This study highlights the effect of GA(3) on the profiles of certain polyphenols impacting the flavone and flavonol biosynthesis pathways and hence the nutritional aspect of grapes. The results of this study would be useful to develop self-elongating varieties simplifying the grape cultivation.

The study presents a proof of concept for an effective exploitation of the complementary nature of tandem ionization data. Samples are taken from two sub-populations of severely obese (BMI > 40 kg/m(2)) patients, named metabolically healthy obese (MHO) and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO). Untargeted fingerprinting, based on pattern recognition by template matching, is applied on single data streams and on fused data, obtained by combining raw signals from the two ionization energies (12 and 70 eV). Results indicate that at lower energy (i.e., 12 eV), the total signal intensity is one order of magnitude lower compared to the reference signal at 70 eV, but the ranges of variations for 2D peak responses is larger, extending the dynamic range. Fused data combine benefits from 70 eV and 12 eV resulting in more comprehensive coverage by sample fingerprints. Multivariate statistics, principal component analysis (PCA), and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) show quite good patient clustering, with total explained variance by the first two principal components (PCs) that increases from 54% at 70 eV to 59% at 12 eV and up to 71% for fused data. With PLS-DA, discriminant components are highlighted and putatively identified by comparing retention data and 70 eV spectral signatures. Within the most informative analytes, lactose is present in higher relative amount in saliva from MHO patients, whereas N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, urea, glucuronic acid gamma-lactone, 2-deoxyribose, N-acetylneuraminic acid methyl ester, and 5-aminovaleric acid are more abundant in MUO patients. Visual feature fingerprinting is combined with pattern recognition algorithms to highlight metabolite variations between composite per-class images obtained by combining raw data from individuals belonging to different classes, i.e., MUO vs. MHO.

The present study focuses on the development of effective bioformulation towards suppression of blossom blight and plant growth promotion in rose. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (VB2) and Bacillus subtilis (AP) effectively inhibited mycelial growth of B. cinerea in vitro. Genome screening of VB2 and AP revealed the presence of antimicrobial peptide genes including, ituD, ipa14, bacA, bacD, srfA, sfP, spaC, spaS responsible for the biosynthesis of antibiotics such as iturin, bacilysin, bacillomycin, surfactin and subtilin. Further, the presence of volatile antifungal compounds in the bacterial secretome was identified through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis. Upon treatment, AP accelerated the metabolite profile of the plants and a rise in peak area of antifungal compounds such as, pentadecanoic acid, n-hexadecanoic acid, octadecanoic acid (stearic acid) and tetradecanoic acid was observed. In vitro, VB2 produced maximum indole acetic acid (9.17 mu g/ml) and gibberellic acid (8.20 mu g/ml) in nutrient broth. Under field conditions, foliar spray of VB2 at 0.5% (5 ml/l), four times at weekly interval suppressed blossom blight incidence (64% reduction over control) and also promoted yield. Future research towards development of an effective bioformulation with extended shelf life will aid in the management of various fungal, bacterial and viral diseases in different crop plants.

Here, we used a comprehensive single-cell multiomics view of the effects of ginsenosides on cancer cells. Transcriptome and proteome profiling revealed that the antitumor activity of ginsenosides is closely associated with P53 protein. A miRNA-proteome interaction network revealed that P53 controlled the transcription of at least 38 proteins, and proteome-metabolome profiling analysis revealed that P53 regulated proteins involved in nucleotide metabolism, amino acid metabolism and "Warburg effect". The results of integrative multiomics analysis revealed P53 protein as a potential key target that influences the anti-tumor activity of ginsenosides. Furthermore, by applying affinity mass spectrometry (MS) screening and surface plasmon resonance fragment library screening, we confirmed that 20(S)-protopanaxatriol directly targeted adjacent regions of the P53 DNA-binding pocket and promoted the stability of P53-DNA interactions, which further induced a series of omits changes.

However, its clinical application is limited by the incomplete exploration of targets and inadequate discussion of mechanisms. We aimed to investigate the metabolic alterations of XFZYD in acute and chronic stages of TBI. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into the sham, controlled cortical impact (CCI) and XFZYD group. Behavioral and histopathological tests were used to evaluate the neuroprotective effects. Coagulation assays were performed to assess safety. Moreover, we analyzed the metabolomic profiling of hippocampal samples with different time intervals after CCI by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Differential metabolites were screened by multivariate data analysis. To further uncover the association between candidate metabolites and biological interaction networks, we applied bioinformatics analysis using MetaboAnalyst 4.0, STITCH 5.0 and TCMSP. The potential mechanism was verified by ELISA and Western blot. XFZYD ameliorated neurological deficiencies post-CCI without impairing blood coagulation in the rat's model. Seventeen and fourteen metabolites were filtered on d 3 and 21, respectively. Eleven of potential metabolites were common at these time points, involving two significant pathways (arginine and proline metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis). Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the related pathways were specifically affected by XFZYD at the acute phase of TBI, while biosynthesis of amino acids was the major pathway influenced at the chronic phase. This study provides broad insights into the therapeutic effects of XFZYD in treating TBI through the whole phases.

Pre-treatment samples prospectively collected at baseline from a randomized phase III trial were assayed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (n= 341) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) (n= 297). Distributions of time to event outcomes were estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis, and baseline characteristics adjusted Cox regression modeling was used to correlate markers' levels to time to event outcomes. Sixteen polar metabolites were significantly correlated with overall survival (OS) by univariate analysis (p< 0.025). Formate, 2-hydroxybutyrate, glycine andmyo-inositol were selected for a multivariate model. The median OS was 6.6 months in the high-risk group compared to 11.4 months in the low risk group HR (Hazard Ratio) = 1.99, 95% C.I. (Confidence Interval) 1.45-2.68;p< 0.0001). Modeling of lipids by class (sphingolipids, acylcarnitines and lysophosphatidylcholines) revealed a median OS = 5.7 months vs. 11. 9 months for the high vs. low risk group. (HR: 2.23, 95% C.I. 1.55-3.20;p< 0.0001). These results demonstrate that metabolic profiles from pre-treatment samples may be useful to stratify clinical outcomes for mNSCLC patients receiving chemotherapy.

The aim of this study was to investigate the most direct changes in energy metabolism and small-molecule metabolism of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells infected with H3N2 canine influenza virus (CIV) and to determine whether small metabolites contribute to the pathogenesis of CIV. To study the metabolomics of MDCK cells infected with H3N2 CIV, we used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry combined with multivariate statistical analysis. The results showed that 798 positive ions were detected, among which 33 were upregulated and 11 were downregulated, and 406 negative ions were detected, among which 33 were upregulated and 9 were downregulated. Through Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis, we found that these differentially expressed molecules were mainly concentrated in the steroid hormone biosynthesis, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, vitamin B6 metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, vitamin digestion and absorption, arginine and proline metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, and folate biosynthesis metabolic pathways. These pathways are involved in energy metabolism and nucleic acid and protein synthesis, which are essential for virus replication. Our experimental data suggest that H3N2 CIV infection reconstitutes/influences cellular metabolic processes, which in turn may contribute to viral replication. These findings are important for the development of enzyme inhibitors or metabolites for the identification of antiviral drugs. In addition, understanding the metabolic interaction between CIV and host cells is also very important for the complex pathogenicity of CIV, providing certain guidance for the treatment of canine influenza.

This hampers strain prioritization and compound identification and can lead to overinterpretation of chemical diversity. Here, we assessed the metabolic potential of Nocardia, an underinvestigated actinobacterial genus that is known to comprise opportunistic human pathogens. Our analysis revealed a plethora of putative biosynthetic gene clusters of various classes, including polyketide, nonribosomal peptide, and terpenoid pathways. Furthermore, we used the highly conserved biosynthetic pathway for nocobactin-like siderophores to investigate how gene cluster differences correlate to structural differences in the produced compounds. Sequence similarity networks generated by BiG-SCAPE (Biosynthetic Gene Similarity Clustering and Prospecting Engine) showed the presence of several distinct gene cluster families. Metabolic profiling of selected Nocardia strains using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics data, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and GNPS (Global Natural Product Social molecular networking) revealed that nocobactin-like biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) families above a BiG-SCAPE threshold of 70% can be assigned to distinct structural types of nocobactin-like siderophores. IMPORTANCE Our work emphasizes that Nocardia represent a prolific source for natural products rivaling better-characterized genera such as Streptomyces or Amycolatopsis. Furthermore, we showed that large-scale analysis of biosynthetic gene clusters using similarity networks with high stringency allows the distinction and prediction of natural product structural variations. This will facilitate future genomics-driven drug discovery campaigns.

However, no comprehensive urinary metabolomic analysis of vitiligo is presently available. To investigate the urine metabolic pattern of vitiligo patients, we conducted a combined cross-sectional and prospective self-control cohort study and an untargeted urinary metabolomic analysis. In the cross-sectional study, 295 vitiligo patients and 192 age- and sex-matched controls were enrolled, and 71 differential metabolites between two groups were identified. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that drug metabolism-cytochrome P450, biopterin metabolism, vitamin B9 (folate) metabolism, selenoamino acid metabolism, and methionine and cysteine metabolism showed significant enrichment in vitiligo patients compared with the status in healthy controls. In the self- control cohort, 46 active vitiligo patients were recruited to analyse the urinary metabolic signatures after treatment. All of these patients were asked to undertake follow-up visits every 2 months three times after first consulting and the disease stage was evaluated compared with that at the last visit. Folate metabolism, linoleate metabolism, leukotriene metabolism, alkaloid biosynthesis, and tyrosine metabolism were predicted to be involved in vitiligo activity. Our study is the first attempt to reveal urinary metabolic signatures of vitiligo patients and provides new insights into the metabolic mechanisms of vitiligo.

Moreover, saliva collection is easy and noninvasive, which is especially valuable for cohorts in which sample collection is challenging, for example, infants and children. With this rationale, we established a validated ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) method for salivary metabolic profiling and fingerprinting. Hereby, 450 mu L of saliva was centrifuged and passed over a 0.45-mu m polyamide membrane filter, after which the extract was subjected to chromatographic analysis (HSS T3 column) and QExactive Orbitrap-MS. For the majority of the profiled metabolites, good linearity (R-2 >= 0.99) and precision (coefficient of variance <= 15%) was achieved. The fingerprinting performance was evaluated based on the complete metabolome (11 385 components), whereby 76.8% was found compliant with the criteria for precision (coefficient of variance <= 30%) and 82.7% with linearity (R-2 >= 0.99). In addition, the method was proven fitfor-purpose for a cohort of 140 adolescents (6-16 years, stratified according to weight), yielding relevant profiles (45 obesity-related metabolites) and discriminative fingerprints (Q(2) of 0.784 for supervised discriminant analysis). Alternatively, laser-assisted rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (LA-REIMS) was established for rapid fingerprinting of saliva, thereby using a Nd:YAG laser and Xevo G2-XS QToF-MS. With an acquisition time of 0.5 min per sample, LA-REIMS offers unique opportunities for point-of-care applications. In conclusion, this work presents a platform of UHPLC-HRMS and LA-REIMS, complementing each other to perform salivary metabolomics.

Metabolomic Analysis for Compositional Differences of Bush Tea (Athrixia phylicoides DC.) Subjected to Seasonal Dynamics	AGRONOMY-BASEL			English	Article						bush tea; seasonal variation; Athrixia phylicoides; tea metabolites; phenolics	CAMELLIA-SINENSIS METABOLITES; GREEN TEA; PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; STRESS; QUANTIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; ACCUMULATION; TEMPERATURE; EXTRACTS	Bush tea (Athrixia phylicoidesDC.) is a South African indigenous herbal tea rich in secondary metabolites with medicinal significance. However, studies on the effects of seasonal changes on bush tea and quantification of its metabolites using untargeted approach have not been explored. Therefore, this study's objective was to investigate the effects of seasonal variation on the metabolites of bush tea using LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography with Tandem Mass Spectrometry) and(1)H NMR (High-Resolution Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) techniques. Bush tea leaves were plucked once in each season namely, autumn (March to May), winter (June to August), spring (September to November), and summer (December to February). The primary metabolites including non-essential amino acids, organic acids, and vitamins in bush tea were predominantly elevated during summer and spring. The(1)H NMR-based metabolomic analysis revealed that bush tea metabolome was strongly affected by seasonal variations, using the partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) which demonstrated four distinct groups of seasons. Similarly, the(1)H NMR based metabolic profiling of bush tea subjected to different seasons resulted in putative annotation of six phenolic compounds which included rutin, 4-(hydroxyphenyl) propyl coumarate, caffeic acid, hymenoxin, quercetin, and kaempferol. The phenolics and primary metabolites differed remarkably per season with enhanced accumulation observed in the summer and spring harvested bush tea. The LC-MS and(1)H NMR metabolomics analysis suggests that summer and spring can be recommended as preferred plucking seasons for bush tea leaves and twigs.

Sera were analysed using H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS). Multivariate data analysis was used to distinguish patients with TB from other diseases. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. Model performance was tested in a validation cohort of 36 children from the UK. Data acquired using H-1 NMR demonstrated a sensitivity, specificity and Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 69% (95% confidence interval [CI], 56-73%), 83% (95% CI, 73-93%), and 0.78 respectively, and correctly classified 20% of the validation cohort from the UK. The most discriminatory MS data showed a sensitivity of 67% (95% CI, 60-71%), specificity of 86% (95% CI, 75-93%) and an AUC of 0.78, correctly classifying 83% of the validation cohort. Amongst children with presumptive TB, metabolic profiling of sera distinguished bacteriologically-confirmed and clinical TB from other diseases. This novel approach yielded a diagnostic performance for paediatric TB comparable to that of Xpert MTB/RIF and interferon gamma release assays.

The aim of this study was to identify the metabolomic composition of lyophilized extract of mango leaf (MIE), to evaluate the antioxidant activity on several oxidative stress systems (DPPH, FRAP, TBARS, and ABTS), the spasmolytic and antispasmodic activity, and intestinal protective effect on oxidative stress induced by H2O2 in rat ileum. Twenty-nine metabolites were identified and characterized based on their ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) high-resolution orbitrap mass spectrometry, these include: benzophenone derivatives, xanthones, phenolic acids, fatty acids, flavonoids and procyanidins. Extract demonstrated a high antioxidant activity in in-vitro assays. MIE relaxed (p < 0.001) intestinal segments of rat pre-contracted with acetylcholine (ACh) (10(-5) M). Pre-incubation of intestinal segments with 100 mu g/mL MIE significantly reduced (p < 0.001) the contraction to H2O2. Similar effects were observed with mangiferin and quercetin (10(-5) M; p < 0.05) but not for gallic acid. Chronic treatment of rats with MIE (50 mg/kg) for 28 days significantly reduced (p < 0.001) the H2O2-induced contractions. MIE exhibited a strong antioxidant activity, spasmolytic and antispasmodic activity, which could contribute to its use as an alternative for the management of several intestinal diseases related to oxidative stress.

Vaginal metabolites are influenced by resident vaginal microbiota, affect susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and may impact local inflammation and patient symptoms. Examining the vaginal metabolome in the context of CT mono (CT+) and CT/MG co-infection (CT+/MG+) may identify biomarkers for infection or provide new insights into disease etiology and pathogenesis. Yet, the vaginal metabolome in the setting of CT infection is understudied and the composition of the vaginal metabolome in CT/MG co-infected women is unknown. Therefore, in this analysis, we used an untargeted metabolomic approach combined with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to characterize the vaginal microbiota and metabolomes of CT+, CT+/MG+, and uninfected women. We found that CT+ and CT+/MG+ women had distinct vaginal metabolomic profiles as compared to uninfected women both before and after adjustment for the vaginal microbiota. This study provides important foundational data documenting differences in the vaginal metabolome between CT+, CT+/MG+ and uninfected women. These data may guide future mechanistic studies that seek to provide insight into the pathogenesis of CT and CT/MG infections.

The aim of the study was to identify and quantify the metabolites present in HBV. To gain the highest metabolite coverage, three different mass spectrometry (MS)-based methodologies were applied. In the first step, untargeted metabolomics was used, which employed high-resolution, accurate-mass Orbitrap MS. It allowed obtaining a broad overview of HBV metabolic components. Then, two targeted metabolomics approaches, which employed triple quadrupole MS, were applied to quantify metabolites in HBV samples. The untargeted metabolomics not only confirmed the presence of amines, amino acids, carbohydrates, and organic acids in HBV, but also provided information on venom components from other metabolite classes (e.g., nucleosides, alcohols, purine and pyrimidine derivatives). The combination of three MS-based metabolomics platforms facilitated the identification of 214 metabolites in HBV samples, among which 138 were quantified. The obtaining of the wide free amino acid profiles of HBV is one of the project's achievements. Our study contributed significantly to broadening the knowledge about HBV composition and should be continued to obtain the most comprehensive metabolite profile of HBV.

To better understand the molecular basis of SFN intervention in estrogen-dependent breast cancer, integrated multi-omics data analysis was used to provide evidence and insights into molecular biology. MCF-7 breast cancer cells were treated with estradiol (E-2) or/and SFN. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed by using microarray platforms. The protein profile was analyzed by TMT labeled HPLC-MS/MS. The metabolic profile was obtained by GC-MS and UPLC-MS methods. Multivariate statistics analyses, such as PCA and hierarchical clustering, were performed. The Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG analysis were used to perform enrichment analysis of biological processes and pathways. A set of differentially methylated genes and differentially expressed proteins and metabolites were found, which indicated that SFN may reverse the adverse effects induced by E-2. Integrated analysis revealed cancer genes that responded to estrogen and other pathways frequently associated with cancer. Co-pathway analysis revealed that the reversal effects of SFN were associated with purine metabolism and glutathione metabolism. The integrated omics analysis outlined a promising blueprint of the relationship of biological molecules in different dimensions, which will be beneficial for understanding the mechanism of anti-breast cancer effects and for new targets of medicines.

Cells cultured in 30 mg selenite/L supplemented medium could bind 1368 mu g Se/g of dry weight in their structures. Increased accumulation of trehalose and glycogen was observed, which indicated cell response to stress conditions. The activity of antioxidative enzymes (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, thioredoxin reductase, and glutathione S-transferase) was significantly higher than that of the control without Se addition. Most Se was bound to water-insoluble protein fraction; in addition, the yeast produced 20-30 nm Se nanoparticles (SeNPs). Part of Se was metabolized to selenomethionine (10%) and selenocysteine (20%). The HPLC-ESI-Orbitrap MS analysis showed the presence of five Se compounds combined with glutathione in the yeast. The obtained results form the basis for further research on the mechanisms of Se metabolism in yeast cells.

We hypothesize that deficits in the capacity of the placenta to maintain bioenergetic and metabolic stability during pregnancy may result in spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB). To explore this hypothesis, we performed a nested cased control study of metabolomic signatures in placentas from women with SPTB (<36 weeks gestation) compared to normal pregnancies (>= 38 weeks gestation). To control for the effects of gestational age on placenta metabolism, we also studied a subset of metabolites in non-laboring preterm and term Rhesus monkeys. Comprehensive quantification of metabolites demonstrated a significant elevation in the levels of amino acids, prostaglandins, sphingolipids, lysolipids, and acylcarnitines in SPTB placenta compared to term placenta. Additional quantification of placental acylcarnitines by tandem mass spectrometry confirmed the significant elevation in SPTB human, with no significant differences between midgestation and term placenta in Rhesus macaque. Fatty acid oxidation as measured by the flux of H-3-palmitate in SPTB placenta was lower than term. Collectively, significant and biologically relevant alterations in the placenta metabolome were identified in SPTB placenta. Altered acylcarnitine levels and fatty acid oxidation suggest that disruption in normal substrate metabolism is associated with SPTB.

Rhodiola crenulata extract (RCE) has shown its protective effects on AD, however, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. In this work, serum lipidomics was conducted to reveal the action mechanism of RCE on AD by HPLC coupled with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). The animal model of AD was reproduced by intrahippocampal injection of A beta(1-42) in rats. The novel object recognition test and passive avoidance test were performed to evaluate the protective effects of RCE on AD rats. The differences of lipid metabolism profiles in rats were evaluated by multivariate statistical analysis. Then, the potential lipid biomarkers were identified and the possible mechanism of RCE on AD was elucidated by metabolic pathways analysis. As a result, twenty-eight lipids with significant differences between the control group and the model group were screened out. With the treatment of RCE, 19 lipids in AD rats showed a trend of callback to the normal levels. The results of pathway analysis indicated that the protective effects of RCE on AD might be closely related to the regulation of linoleic acid metabolism, alpha-linoleic acid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism and ether lipid metabolism. In conclusion, this study provides a new perspective on the potential intervention mechanism of RCE for AD treatment.

Modulation of the Tomato Fruit Metabolome by LED Light	METABOLITES			English	Article						tomato; metabolomics; light regulation; irradiance; light spectrum	LYCOPENE; TOOL; BIOSYNTHESIS; CANCER; AROMA	Metabolic profiles of tomatoes change during ripening and light can modulate the activity of relevant biochemical pathways. We investigated the effects of light directly supplied to the fruits on the metabolome of the fruit pericarp during ripening. Mature green tomatoes were exposed to well-controlled conditions with light as the only varying factor; control fruits were kept in darkness. In experiment 1 the fruits were exposed to either white light or darkness for 15 days. In experiment 2, fruits were exposed to different light spectra (blue, green, red, far-red, white) added to white background light for seven days. Changes in the global metabolome of the fruit pericarp were monitored using LCMS and GCMS (554 compounds in total). Health-beneficial compounds (carotenoids, flavonoids, tocopherols and phenolic acids) accumulated faster under white light compared to darkness, while alkaloids and chlorophylls decreased faster. Light also changed the levels of taste-related metabolites including glutamate and malate. The light spectrum treatments indicated that the addition of blue light was the most effective treatment in altering the fruit metabolome. We conclude that light during ripening of tomatoes can have various effects on the metabolome and may help with shaping the levels of key compounds involved in various fruit quality characteristics.

To further increase metabolite coverage and achieve high accuracy of metabolite quantification, the present proof-of-principle study was to explore the applicability of integration of two-dimensional gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC x GC-MS and 2DLC-MS) platforms to characterizing circulating polar metabolome extracted from plasma collected from 29 individuals with colorectal cancer in comparison with 29 who remained cancer-free. After adjustment of multiple comparisons, 20 metabolites were found to be up-regulated and 8 metabolites were found to be down-regulated, which pointed to the dysregulation in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. While integrating the GC x GC-MS and 2DLC-MS data can dramatically increase the metabolite coverage, this study had a limitation in analyzing the non-polar metabolites. Given the small sample size, these results need to be validated with a larger sample size and with samples collected prior to diagnostic and treatment. Nevertheless, this proof-of-principle study demonstrates the potential applicability of integration of these advanced analytical platforms to improve discrimination between colorectal cancer cases and controls based on metabolite profiles in future studies.

In nature, prokaryotes are characterized with the most impressing FA structural diversity and the highest relative content of free fatty acids (FFAs). In this context, nitrogen-fixing bacteria (order Rhizobiales), the symbionts of legumes, are particularly interesting. Indeed, the FA profiles influence the structure of rhizobial nodulation factors, required for successful infection of plant root. Although FA patterns can be assessed by gas chromatography-(GC-) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), sample preparation for these methods is time-consuming and quantification suffers from compromised sensitivity, low stability of derivatives and artifacts. In contrast, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) represents an excellent platform for high-efficient metabolite fingerprinting, also applicable to FFAs. Therefore, here we propose a simple and straightforward protocol for high-throughput relative quantification of FFAs in rhizobia by combination of Langmuir technology and MALDI-TOF-MS featuring a high sensitivity, accuracy and precision of quantification. We describe a step-by-step procedure comprising rhizobia culturing, pre-cleaning, extraction, sample preparation, mass spectrometric analysis, data processing and post-processing. As a case study, a comparison of the FFA metabolomes of two rhizobia species-Rhizobium leguminosarum and Sinorhizobium meliloti, demonstrates the analytical potential of the protocol.

This study profiled the polyphenol metabolites in 7 Chinese peach and nectarine varieties at thinned and ripe stages by HPLC and UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS. A total of 58 phenolic metabolites were identified in peach and nectarine. Neochlorogenic acid, catechin and chlorogenic acid were the dominant polyphenols in 7 varieties at both thinned and ripe stages. Regarding fruits at the thinned stage, phenolic acids were the major metabolic markers that distinguished 7 different peach and nectarine varieties, whereas flavonoids were the main metabolites differentiated the ripe fruit. Moreover, 3-p-coumaroyl quinic acid, 1-caffeoylquinic acid, myricetin, and kaempferol-3-o-rutinoside were the vital phenolic markers that differentiated thinned young fruit from the ripe one. There were significant differences in the polyphenol metabolic profile in different peach and nectarine varieties in different maturity stages. This work would provide a reference for further peach and nectarine phenolic metabolites investigation.

Dynamic metabolic reprogramming in dendritic cells: An early response to influenza infection that is essential for effector function	PLOS PATHOGENS			English	Article							CD8(+) T-CELLS; GLUTAMINE-METABOLISM; AEROBIC GLYCOLYSIS; GENE-EXPRESSION; STRANDED-RNA; LYMPH-NODES; MYC; VIRUS; GLUCOSE; PROTEIN	Author summary Dendritic cells are critical in mounting an effective immune response to influenza infection by initiating the immune response to influenza and activating the adaptive response to mediate viral clearance and manifest immune memory for protection against subsequent infections. We found dendritic cells undergo a profound metabolic shift after infection. They alter the concentration and location of hundreds of proteins, including c-Myc, facilitating a shift to a highly glycolytic phenotype that is also flexible in terms of fueling respiration. Nonetheless, we found limiting access to specific metabolic pathways or substrates diminished key immune functions. We previously described an immediate, fixed hypermetabolic state in infected respiratory epithelial cells. Here we present data indicating the metabolic response of dendritic cells is increased yet flexible, distinct from what we previously showed for epithelial cells. Additionally, we demonstrate dendritic cells tailor their metabolic response to the pathogen or TLR stimulus. This metabolic reprogramming occurs rapidly in vitro and is sustained in inflammatory dendritic cells in vivo for at least 9 days following influenza infection. These studies introduce the possibility of modulating the immune response to viral infection using customized metabolic therapy to enhance or diminish the function of specific cells. Infection with the influenza virus triggers an innate immune response that initiates the adaptive response to halt viral replication and spread. However, the metabolic response fueling the molecular mechanisms underlying changes in innate immune cell homeostasis remain undefined. Although influenza increases parasitized cell metabolism, it does not productively replicate in dendritic cells. To dissect these mechanisms, we compared the metabolism of dendritic cells to that of those infected with active and inactive influenza A virus and those treated with toll-like receptor agonists. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, pulse chase substrate utilization assays and metabolic flux measurements, we found global metabolic changes in dendritic cells 17 hours post infection, including significant changes in carbon commitment via glycolysis and glutaminolysis, as well as mitochondrial respiration. Influenza infection of dendritic cells led to a metabolic phenotype distinct from that induced by TLR agonists, with significant resilience in terms of metabolic plasticity. We identified c-Myc as one transcription factor modulating this response. Restriction of c-Myc activity or mitochondrial substrates significantly changed the immune functions of dendritic cells, such as reducing motility and T cell activation. Transcriptome analysis of inflammatory dendritic cells isolated following influenza infection showed similar metabolic reprogramming occurs in vivo. Thus, early in the infection process, dendritic cells respond with global metabolic restructuring, that is present in inflammatory lung dendritic cells after infection, and this is important for effector function. These findings suggest metabolic switching in dendritic cells plays a vital role in initiating the immune response to influenza infection.

CRC occurs sporadically in the majority of cases, indicating the predominant cause of the disease are environmental factors. Diet-induced changes in gut-microbiome are recently supposed to contribute on epidemics of CRC. This study was aimed to investigate the association of metagenomics and metabolomics in gut extracellular vesicles (EVs) of CRC and healthy subjects. A total of 40 healthy volunteers and 32 patients with CRC were enrolled in this study. Metagenomic profiling by sequencing 16S rDNA was performed for assessing microbial codiversity. We explored the small molecule metabolites using gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In total, stool EVs were prepared from 40 healthy volunteers and 32 patients with CRC. Metagenomic profiling demonstrated that bacterial phyla, particularly of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, were significantly altered in patients with colorectal cancer. Through metabolomics profiling, we determined seven amino acids, four carboxylic acids, and four fatty acids; including short-chain to long chain fatty acids that altered in the disease group. Binary logistic regression was further tested to evaluate the diagnostic performance. In summary, the present findings suggest that gut flora dysbiosis may result in alternation of amino acid metabolism, which may be correlated with the pathogenesis of CRC.

For this purpose, the LC-MS/MS system was used for the quantitative and qualitative analysis of 37 phytochemicals. The main component of the flower, leaf and root extracts was the quinic acid (160, 111 and 64 mg/kg, respectively). Antioxidant activities were determined using methods such as DPPH (SC50, mg/mL), FRAP (mu M TEAC), CUPRAC (mu M TEAC), ABTS (SC50, mg/mL) and TPC (GAE, mu g/mL). While the highest antioxidant activity value for FRAP, CUPRAC, ABTS and TPC methods was determined in the leaf part of the plant, this value was determined in the flower part for DPPH. The antibacterial effects of the plant extracts were determined by liquid microdilution and agar diffusion methods. As a result, antimicrobial effect of flowers, leaf and all sections of plant extracts were determined except plant root extracts which did not display any activity against bacteria. Antimicrobial activity of the plant flower extract was found to be higher especially against to P. vulgaris with 3.5 mg/mL MIC.

A Novel Cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 11802 has Distinct Genomic and Metabolomic Characteristics Compared to its Neighbor PCC 11801	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							RATIO OUTLIER ANALYSIS; PHOTOSYNTHETIC PRODUCTION; CARBON FLUX; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; GLYCOGEN MUTANT; ANTITOXIN; METABOLITES; ANNOTATION; CONVERSION; ALIGNMENT	Cyanobacteria, a group of photosynthetic prokaryotes, are attractive hosts for biotechnological applications. It is envisaged that future biorefineries will deploy engineered cyanobacteria for the conversion of carbon dioxide to useful chemicals via light-driven, endergonic reactions. Fast-growing, genetically amenable, and stress-tolerant cyanobacteria are desirable as chassis for such applications. The recently reported strains such as Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 and PCC 11801 hold promise, but additional strains may be needed for the ongoing efforts of metabolic engineering. Here, we report a novel, fast-growing, and naturally transformable cyanobacterium, S. elongatus PCC 11802, that shares 97% genome identity with its closest neighbor S. elongatus PCC 11801. The new isolate has a doubling time of 2.8h at 1% CO2, 1000 mu mole photons.m(-2).s(-1) and grows faster under high CO2 and temperature compared to PCC 11801 thus making it an attractive host for outdoor cultivations and eventual applications in the biorefinery. Furthermore, S. elongatus PCC 11802 shows higher levels of key intermediate metabolites suggesting that this strain might be better suited for achieving high metabolic flux in engineered pathways. Importantly, metabolite profiles suggest that the key enzymes of the Calvin cycle are not repressed under elevated CO2 in the new isolate, unlike its closest neighbor.

But, there are still no objective methods to diagnose PSD. This study aims to identify potential biomarkers for diagnosing PSD in middle-aged stroke survivors. Methods: Middle-aged subjects aged 30 to 59 years (92 PSD patients and 89 stroke survivors without depression) were included in this study. Urinary metabolites were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Differential urinary metabolites and potential biomarkers were screened by applying statistical analysis. Results: The different urinary metabolic phenotypes between PSD patients and stroke survivors without depression were identified. A total of 12 differential urinary metabolites were accurately identified by using orthogonal partial least-squares-discriminant analysis. After analyzing those 12 differential urinary metabolites by step-wise logistic regression analysis, only seven metabolites (palmitic acid, hydroxylamine, myristic acid, glyceric acid, lactic acid, tyrosine and azelaic acid) were finally selected as potential biomarkers for diagnosing PSD in middle-aged stroke survivors. A panel consisting of these potential biomarkers could effectively diagnose middle-aged PSD patients. Conclusion: Urinary metabolic profiles were different between middle-aged PSD patients and stroke survivors without depression. Our results would be helpful in future for developing an objective method to diagnose PSD in middle-aged stroke survivors.

Lipid accumulation has been reported to present in the hearts of DCM animals, however characterization of disordered lipids, and their roles in the etiology and progress of DCM remain largely undefined. In present study, an untargeted lipidomics based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometers was established for global detection of lipids in the hearts of DCM mice. DCM mice showed significant cardiac dysfunction with decreased left ventricular fractional shortening (FS) and ratio of peak early filling velocity to atrial filling velocity (MV E/A). Histological lesion, fibrosis, hypertrophy, and lipid accumulation were also observed in the heart of DCM mice. By lipidomics analysis, a total of 244 lipids were identified, of which 89 lipids were significantly changed. The disordered metabolic profile of lipids in DCM mice heart were characterized by the accumulation of triacylglycerol, glycerophospholipid, cholesterol-sulfate, ceramide and sphingomyelin, as well as by the loss of glycerophospholipid. The lipid alterations in the heart were correlated with the development of cardiac dysfunction, lipotoxicity, inflammation and insulin resistance. Correlations between lipid metabolism disorders and DCM progress should be further explored. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The chemical structures of the isolated compounds were established on the basis of their 1D NMR and HRMS spectral data. Metabolic profiling of theH. spiniferaextract indicated the presence of diverse secondary metabolites, mostly hydroxy fatty acids, diterpenes, triterpenes, and cerebrosides. The isolated compounds were tested for their in vitro cytotoxicities against the breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cell line. Compounds1,2,3, and4displayed promising cytotoxic activities against MCF-7 cells, with IC(50)values of 13.83, 8.13, 8.27, and 35.56 mu M, respectively, compared to that of the standard drug doxorubicin (IC(50)8.64 mu M). Additionally, docking studies were performed for compounds1,2,3, and4to elucidate their binding interactions with the active site of the SET protein, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which could explain their cytotoxic activity. This study highlights the important role of these metabolites in the defense mechanism of the sea cucumber against fouling organisms and the potential uses of these active molecules in the design of new anticancer agents.

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) shows unique advantage in the treatment of psoriasis based on syndrome differentiation. An untargeted high-throughput metabonomics method based on liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry was applied to study the serum metabolic characteristics in different TCM syndrome types in patients with psoriasis vulgaris (PV), and to discover potential serum biomarkers for its pathogenesis on the endogenous metabolite differentiation basis. The serum metabolic profiles of 45 healthy controls and 124 patients with PV (50 in the blood-stasis group, 30 in the blood-heat group, and 44 in the blood-dryness group) were acquired. The raw spectrometric data were processed using multivariate statistical analysis, and 14 biomarkers related to TCM syndrome differentiation and psoriasis types were screened and identified. The blood-stasis syndrome group showed abnormal lipid metabolism, which was characterized by a low level of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and a high level of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). We propose that platelet-activating factor can be applied as a potential biomarker in clinical diagnosis and differentiation of PV with blood-stasis syndrome. The difference in the serum metabolites among PV types with different TCM syndromes and healthy control group illustrated the objective material basis in TCM syndrome differentiation and classification of psoriasis.

The untargeted profiling based on UHPLC-QTOF metabolomics allowed annotating 316 compounds, comprising mainly polyphenols and lipids. An impact of storage on the total phenolic content (TPC) was observed, with a maximum increase at 10-days of storage for both red beet (+ 1.3-fold) and amaranth (+ 1.1-fold). On the other hand, in vitro digestion of both red beet and amaranth microgreens produced a significant increase in TPC (36-88%), CUPRAC (27-40%), DPPH (6-43%), and BC (41-57%) to reach the maximum at 10 days of storage. Tyrosinase inhibitory potential also decreased following digestion. The combination of biochemical changes occurring in microgreen immature plants (likely in response to the harvest stress) with changes during digestion, determined the actual functional value of microgreens.

Efforts to improve productivity through medium design and feeding strategy optimization have focused on preventing the depletion of essential nutrients and managing the accumulation of lactate and ammonia. In addition to ammonia and lactate, many other metabolites accumulate in CHO cell cultures, although their effects remain largely unknown. Elucidating these effects has the potential to further improve the productivity of CHO cell-based bioprocesses. This study used untargeted metabolomics to identify metabolites that accumulate in fed-batch cultures of monoclonal antibody (mAb) producing CHO cells. The metabolomics experiments profiled six cell lines that are derived from two different hosts, produce different mAbs, and exhibit different growth profiles. Comparing the cell lines' metabolite profiles at different growth stages, we found a strong negative correlation between peak viable cell density (VCD) and a tryptophan metabolite, putatively identified as 5-hydroxyindoleacetaldehyde (5-HIAAld). Amino acid supplementation experiments showed strong growth inhibition of all cell lines by excess tryptophan, which correlated with the accumulation of 5-HIAAld in the culture medium. Prospectively, the approach presented in this study could be used to identify cell line- and host-independent metabolite markers for clone selection and bioprocess development.			nalden246@gmail.com; ravali.raju@gmail.com; kyle.mcelearney@gmail.com; james.lambropoulos@biogen.com; Rashmi.kshirsagar@rubiustx.com; alanbgilbert@gmail.com; kyongbum.lee@tufts.edu		Lee, Kyongbum/0000-0002-0699-8057	Biogen (Cambridge, MA, USA); National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [CA211839-01]	This research was funded by Biogen (Cambridge, MA, USA) and the National Institutes of Health (grant number CA211839-01 to KL).		39	4	4	1	3	MDPI	BASEL	ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND		2218-1989		METABOLITES	Metabolites	MAY	2020	10	5							199	10.3390/metabo10050199			15	Biochemistry & Molecular Biology	Biochemistry & Molecular Biology	LW7HZ	WOS:000539315800028	32429145	Green Published, gold			2021-10-14

We investigated the accumulation of compounds and the expression of biosynthesis and signaling genes for eight hormones. The results revealed that ethylene and abscisic acid concentrations increased during the leaf senescence process, while the contents of cytokinin, auxin, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid continued to decrease. Correlation tests between the hormone content and transcriptional changes were analyzed, and in six pathways, genes closely linked with leaf senescence were identified.ConclusionsThese results will enrich our understanding of the mechanisms of plant hormones that regulate leaf senescence in red maple, while establishing a foundation for the genetic modification of Acer in the future.

Exhaustive literature review reveals lack of comprehensive reports on its biotransformation. With a view to study the same, the present study reports the identification and characterization of metabolites of CET in rats using UPLC-MS/MS. As the small intestine is the site of action for CET, it is important that the role of microbial flora in the metabolism of CET be explored. To achieve this, the metabolic profile of CET was compared between normal and pseudo-germ-free rats. The study involved the administration of a drug suspension to male Sprague-Dawley pseudo-germ-free and normal untreated rats followed by collection of urine, feces, and blood at specific intervals. Sample preparation was performed using liquid-liquid extraction and concentration of samples followed by analysis using LC-MS/MS. Finally, an in silico study was performed on the drug and metabolites to predict their toxicological properties using ADMET Predictor(TM) software. Four metabolites of CET were observed in in vivo matrices. As expected, significant changes were observed both qualitatively and quantitatively, implying that formation of metabolites was both CYP enzymes and gut microflora mediated.

However, the role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in nanomaterials-induced neurotoxicity remains largely unknown. In this study, young mice aged 4 weeks were treated with either a vehicle solution or 26 mg kg(-1) zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) by intragastric administration for 30 days. The neurobehavioral alterations were assessed by the Morris water maze and open field test. Gut microbiota and the metabolites in both blood and hippocampus were detected using 16S rRNA sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomics, respectively. The results demonstrated that oral exposure to ZnONPs resulted in neurobehavioral impairments in young mice, mainly manifested by spatial learning and memory deficits, and the inhibition of locomotor activity. Intriguingly, ZnONPs caused a marked disturbance of the gut microbial composition, but did not alter the alpha-diversity of the microbiota. The correlation analysis further revealed that neurobehavioral impairments induced by ZnONPs were closely associated with a perturbation in the gut microbiota composition that were specific to changes of neurobehavior-related genes (such as Bdnf and Dlg4), and correlated with serum and hippocampal metabolites. We also identified a unique metabolite [DG(15:0/0:0/22:4n6)] that linked relationships among the gut microbiota, metabolites and neurobehavior-related genes. Taken together, our results illustrated that oral exposure to ZnONPs not only altered the gut microbiome community, but also substantially disturbed the metabolic profiles leading to neurobehavioral impairments via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. These findings will provide a novel view for understanding the neurotoxicity of ZnONPs, and are helpful for identifying potential prevention and treatment strategies.

This retrospective study examined whether plasma acylcarnitine profiles can help biochemically distinguish the three phenotypic subtypes of major depressive disorder (MDD): core depression (CD+), anxious depression (ANX+), and neurovegetative symptoms of melancholia (NVSM+). Methods: Depressed outpatients (n = 240) from the Mayo Clinic Pharmacogenomics Research Network were treated with citalopram or escitalopram for eight weeks. Plasma samples collected at baseline and after eight weeks of treatment with citalopram or escitalopram were profiled for short-, medium- and long-chain acylcarnitine levels using AbsoluteIDQ (R) p180-Kit and LC-MS. Linear mixed effects models were used to examine whether acylcarnitine levels discriminated the clinical phenotypes at baseline or eight weeks post-treatment, and whether temporal changes in acylcarnitine profiles differed between groups. Results: Compared to ANX+, CD+ and NVSM+ had significantly lower concentrations of short- and long-chain acylcarnitines at both baseline and week 8. In NVSM+, the medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines were also significantly lower in NVSM+ compared to ANX+. Short-chain acylcarnitine levels increased significantly from baseline to week 8 in CD+ and ANX+, whereas medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines significantly decreased in CD+ and NVSM+. Conclusions: In depressed patients treated with SSRIs, beta-oxidation and mitochondrial energetics as evaluated by levels and changes in acylcarnitines may provide the biochemical basis of the clinical heterogeneity of MDD, especially when combined with clinical characteristics.

Diabetic kidney disease is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease across the world. Early identification of DKD is vitally important for the effective prevention and control of it. However, the available indicators are doubtful in the early diagnosis of DKD. This study is aimed at determining novel sensitive and specific biomarkers to distinguish DKD from their counterparts effectively based on the widely targeted metabolomics approach. Materials and Method. This case-control study involved 44 T2DM patients. Among them, 24 participants with DKD were defined as the cases and another 20 without DKD were defined as the controls. The ultraperformance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry system was applied for the assessment of the serum metabolic profiles. Comprehensive analysis of metabolomics characteristics was conducted to detect the candidate metabolic biomarkers and assess their capability and feasibility. Result. A total of 11 differential metabolites, including Hexadecanoic Acid (C16:0), Linolelaidic Acid (C18:2N6T), Linoleic Acid (C18:2N6C), Trans-4-Hydroxy-L-Proline, 6-Aminocaproic Acid, L-Dihydroorotic Acid, 6-Methylmercaptopurine, Piperidine, Azoxystrobin Acid, Lysopc 20:4, and Cuminaldehyde, were determined as the potential biomarkers for the DKD early identification, based on the multivariable generalized linear regression model and receiver operating characteristic analysis. Conclusion. Serum metabolites might act as sensitive and specific biomarkers for DKD early detection. Further longitudinal studies are needed to confirm our findings.

This formula has been used as an effective remedy for treatment of diabetic ischemia clinically. Aim of the study: In previous study, we have reported the therapeutic effect of BZTLF on diabetic vascular dysfunction. However, it remains obscure about the role of metabolic pathways in BZTLF-initiated improvement on hindlimb ischemia. Materials and methods: Diabetic mice with hindlimb ischemia were orally administrated with BZTLF by gavage. The serum samples were prepared for untargeted metabolomic analysis by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer. The metabolic network was built by integrating metabolite data with the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset (GSE3313). Further, quantitative PCR was used to confirm the key target genes. Results: BZTLF treatment remarkably led to the reversal of changed metabolite levels in serum of diabetic mice with hindlimb ischemia, which mainly derived from bacteria, plant and signaling molecules. Also, BZTLF reshaped the metabolic pathways, especially those responsible for metabolism of lipid, gluthanine and tryptophan. In addition, BZTLF led to the reduction of lysophosphatidic acids (LPAs) and increment of triglycerides (TGs) conjugation with non-saturated fatty acids in serum. BZTLF significantly restored the down-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) or the upregulation of interleukin 4-induced 1 (IL4I1) and cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily B member 1 (CYP1B1) at mRNA level, which were key regulatory genes located in metabolic pathways of glutamate and tryptophan. Conclusions: BZTLF improved hindlimb ischemia in diabetic mice by the positive regulation of metabolome changes in serum.

Aim: Based on the cohort study design, we investigated the association of exposure to 12 heavy metals in the first trimester with primary tooth eruption, and the maternal metabolisms in the first trimester which might be related to the above relationship. Methods: Maternal urine samples were collected in their first trimester, and 12 metals (Ti, V, Fe, Co, Cu, As, Se, Cd, Sn, Hg, Tl, U) were measured using the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry method. The maternal metabolome in the first trimester was analyzed by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled mass spectrometry based metabolomics using urine samples. The infant's first tooth eruption time and number of teeth at age one were recorded by oral examination and questionnaire. Results: No significant associations were observed between heavy metals exposure in the first trimester and primary tooth eruption, except for Co. The level of Co was positively associated with time of infant's first tooth eruption, and was negatively associated with the number of teeth at age one. Based on metabolomic profiling, glycine was revealed as the key mediating metabolite, which showed negative correlation with Co and opposite effect of Co in the primary tooth eruption. Conclusions: Prenatal Co exposure in the first trimester might delay the primary tooth eruption in children through the decreased glycine-clisruptecl dentin formation, providing the first evidence and novel insights into the control of prenatal heavy metals exposure for ensuring normal (timely) primary tooth eruption.

To date, diverse molecular markers have been used to guide field phenotypic selection, whereas accurate predictions of complex heterotic traits are rarely reported. Here, we present a practical metabolome-based strategy for predicting yield heterosis in rice. The dissection of population structure based on untargeted metabolite profiles as the initial critical step in multivariate modeling performed better than the screening of predictive variables. Then the assessment of each predictive variable's contribution to predictive models according to all latent factors was more precise than the conventional first one. Metabolites belonging to specific pathways were closely associated with yield heterosis, and the up-regulation of galactose metabolism promoted robust yield heterosis in hybrids under different growth conditions. Our study demonstrates that metabolome-based predictive models with correctly dissected population structure and screened predictive variables can facilitate accurate predictions of yield heterosis and have great potential for establishing molecular marker-based precision breeding programs.

M. longissimus thoracis from lambs with all four possible callipyge genotype (n= 4, C/+, C/C, +/C, and +/+) were collected after 3d aging and analyzed using mass-spectrometry based platforms. Among identified proteomes, cytochrome c (pro-apoptotic protein) was detected with significantly lower abundances in +/C. Anti-apoptotic HSP70, BAG3, and PARK7 were over-abundant in +/C, which could result in delayed apoptosis and possibly attributed to tougher meat in callipyge lambs. Eight glycolysis enzymes were overabundant in +/C lambs, whereas 3 enzymes involved in TCA cycle were overabundant in non-callipyge ones (C/C and/or C/+). Twenty-five metabolites were affected by genotypes (P <.05), including metabolic co-factors, polyphenols, and AA/short peptides. Our omics results provided insightful information for revealing the differences in biochemical attributes caused by callipyge mutation.	[Ma, Danyi; Yu, Qianqian; Kim, Yuan H.

We performed the metabolomic analysis of aqueous humor samples using a non-targeted gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was computed to assess the discrimination capacities of each metabolite marker. Databases including the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and MetaboAnalyst were utilized to search for the potential pathways of metabolites.ResultsAqueous humor metabolomic profiles could well distinguish POAG from controls. Fourteen metabolic biomarkers were identified as potential aqueous humor biomarkers for POAG, yielding AUC values from 0.62 to 0.86. In pathway analysis, Biotin metabolism was highly impacted, implying that these metabolic markers play important roles in the regulation of this pathway.ConclusionsThis study identified valuable metabolic biomarkers and pathways that may facilitate an improved understanding of the POAG pathogenesis. The finding holds translational value in the development of new therapeutic measures for POAG.

This is particularly harmful to modern comprehensive analytical instrumentations that otherwise provide an unprecedented coverage of complex matrices. In this work, we present a global analytical workflow based on comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry. It was optimized for sample preparation and chromatographic separation and validated on in-house quality control (QC) and NIST SRM 1950 samples. It also includes a QC procedure, a multiapproach data (pre)processing workflow, and an original bias control procedure. Compounds of interest were identified using mass, retention, and biological information. As a proof of concept, 35 serum samples representing three subgroups of Crohn's disease (with high, low, and quiescent endoscopic activity) were analyzed along with 33 healthy controls. This led to the selection of 33 unique candidate biomarkers able to classify the Crohn's disease and healthy samples with an orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis Q(2) of 0.48 and a receiver-operating-characteristic area under the curve of 0.85 (100% sensitivity and 82% specificity in cross validation). Fifteen of these 33 candidates were reliably annotated (Metabolomics Standards Initiative level 2).

Different biotic stresses strongly influence the balance of metabolites in plants. The aim of this study was to understand the function and response of resistance associated metabolites which, in turn are involved in many secondary metabolomics pathways to influence defense mechanism of cotton plant. Analysis of non-targeted metabolomics using ultra high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) revealed abundant accumulation of key metabolites including flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, terpenoids, fatty acids and carbohydrates, in response to leaf spot of cotton. The principal component analysis (PCA), orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) score plots illustrated the evidences of variation between two varieties of cotton under mock and pathogen inoculated treatments. Primary metabolism was affected by the up regulation of pyruvate and malate and by the accumulation of carbohydrates like cellobiose and inulobiose. Among 241 resistance related (RR) metabolites, 18 were identified as resistance related constitutive (RRC) and 223 as resistance related induced (RRI) metabolites. Several RRI metabolites, identified in the present study were the precursors for many secondary metabolic pathways. These included phenylpropanoids (stilbenes and furanocoumarin), flavonoids (phlorizin and kaempferol), alkaloids (indolizine and acetylcorynoline) and terpenoids (azelaic acid and oleanolic acid). Our results demonstrated that secondary metabolism, primary metabolism and energy metabolism were more active in resistant cultivar, as compared to sensitive cultivar. Differential protein and fatty acid metabolism was also depicted in both cultivars. Accumulation of these defense related metabolites in resistant cotton cultivar and their suppression in susceptible cotton cultivar revealed the reason of their respective tolerance and susceptibility against A. tubingensis.

Using Multiple Analytical Platforms to Investigate the Androgen Depletion Effects on Fecal Metabolites in a Mouse Model of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus	JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH			English	Article						metabolomics; mass spectrometry; mouse feces; androgen depletion; systemic lupus erythematosus	REGULATORY T-CELLS; PLASMA SEROTONIN CONCENTRATIONS; TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; GUT MICROBIOTA; COMPUTATIONAL PLATFORM; METABOLOMIC ANALYSIS; AUTOIMMUNE-DISEASES; DENDRITIC CELLS; REVERSED-PHASE	Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by circulating autoantibodies that deposit in target organs (e.g., kidneys), resulting in chronic inflammation and eventual destruction of the organ. SLE is much more prevalent in females than males in both humans and spontaneous mouse models of lupus, such as NZBxNZW F1 (BWF1) mice. Depleting androgens by castration dramatically increases the susceptibility of BWF1 male to lupus. We compared fecal metabolite profiles of castrated BWF1 (androgen-depleted) male, intact (androgen-replete) male, and female mice. Four analytical platforms were employed to study the profiles of polar metabolites in mouse feces collected from adult BWF1 mice, and a total of 435 metabolites was identified. Of these, the abundance levels of 72 metabolites were significantly different between castrated and intact male groups, and 63 metabolites were different between female and male groups. Pathway analysis indicated that the pathway differences between castrated and intact male mice closely resembled the pathway differences between female and intact male mice, suggesting that low levels of androgens, whether due to depletion (castrated male) or endogenous (female), are associated with multiple fecal metabolomic alterations, which could potentially affect SLE progression. Our findings demonstrate that analyzing fecal metabolites using multiple analytical platforms holds great promise for detecting metabolomic alterations in complex disease model systems.

Proteomic Responses to Drought Vary Widely Among Eight Diverse Genotypes of Rice (Oryza sativa)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES			English	Article						rice; drought stress; shotgun proteomics; label-free quantitation; mass spectrometry	EXPRESSION; STRESS; UPLAND; GROWTH; PLANTS; GENES	Rice is a critically important food source but yields worldwide are vulnerable to periods of drought. We exposed eight genotypes of upland and lowland rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica and indica) to drought stress at the late vegetative stage, and harvested leaves for label-free shotgun proteomics. Gene ontology analysis was used to identify common drought-responsive proteins in vegetative tissues, and leaf proteins that are unique to individual genotypes, suggesting diversity in the metabolic responses to drought. Eight proteins were found to be induced in response to drought stress in all eight genotypes. A total of 213 proteins were identified in a single genotype, 83 of which were increased in abundance in response to drought stress. In total, 10 of these 83 proteins were of a largely uncharacterized function, making them candidates for functional analysis and potential biomarkers for drought tolerance.

Fourteen enantiomeric pairs of amino acids could be successfully separated and quantified on a reverse-phase C18 column with an HPLC-MS/MS system after D-BPBr labeling. The chromatographic resolution for D,L-amino acid enantiomers ranged from 1.14 to 8.83 with the L-amino acid derivative always eluting prior to the corresponding D-enantiomer. Meanwhile, D-BPBr showed strong chiral selectivity on D-amino acids, and the ratio of mass spectrometric response for D-BPBr labeled D-amino acids to that of L-enantiomers ranged from 1.31 to 12.87 under the same condition. The D-BPBr labeling method was also demonstrated to be highly efficient and selective in separation and quantification of chiral amino acids especially for trace level D-amino acids in human biofluids including urine and plasma, and in total, 11 L-amino acids and 10 D-amino acids in urine and 11 L-amino acids and 6 D-amino acids in plasma were detected and quantified. Based on the characteristic 2-Da mass difference of precursor ions and the nearly 1:1 peak intensity ratio originated from Br-79 and Br-81 natural isotopes, as well as their dissociation features, 119 amino-containing metabolites were also rapidly detected in urine and plasma samples. Our work indicated that D-BPBr may be a potentially promising tool for the detection of D-amino acid-type biomarkers in disease diagnosis.

Here, the focus is on the connection between two fungi - a yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and a filamentous fungus, Penicillium chrysogenum - in a yeast immobilization system termed' yeast biocapsules', where the yeast and filamentous fungus are strongly attached to one another, forming spherical structures. This co-culture condition hinders filamentous fungal biomass growth, while immobilization of yeast cells continues to increase. The effect of the co-culture condition on endometabolites or intracellular metabolites were tracked during the beginning and end of the yeast biocapsule formation period, and metabolites analyzed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Detector (GC-MSD). Distinct metabolite profiles were found between single culture conditions, involving each organism separately, and with the co-culture condition, where there were differences in 54 endometabolites. Specifically, co-culture condition compounds such as fructose, glycolic acid and glyceric acid were present in higher concentrations at the end of biocapsule formation. These results shed light on the mechanisms and biochemical impact of the interaction between the yeast and filamentous fungus and serve as a basis to apply and further develop yeast biocapsules as a new biotechnological tool with benefits for industry.

Plasma from healthy controls or individuals who have experienced a VTE were analyzed using metabolomics to characterize biomarkers and metabolic systems of patients with VTE. Approach and Results: Polar metabolite and lipidomic profiles from plasma collected 3 months after an incident VTE were obtained using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Fasting-state plasma samples from 42 patients with VTE and 42 healthy controls were measured. Plasma metabolomic profiling identified 512 metabolites forming 62 biological clusters. Multivariate analysis revealed a panel of 21 metabolites altogether capable of predicting VTE status with an area under the curve of 0.92 (P=0.00174, selectivity=0.857, sensitivity=0.971). Multiblock systems analysis revealed 25 of the 62 functional biological groups as significantly affected in the VTE group (P<0.05 to control). Complementary correlation network analysis of the dysregulated functions highlighted a subset of the lipidome composed mainly of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids within the predominant triglycerides as a potential regulator of the post-VTE event biological response, possibly controlling oxidative and inflammatory defence systems, and metabolic disorder associated dysregulations. Of interest was microbiota metabolites including trimethylamine N-oxide that remained associated to post incident VTE patients, highlighting a possible involvement of gut microbiota on VTE risk and relapse. Conclusions: These findings show promise for the elucidation of underlying mechanisms and the design of a diagnostic test to assess the likely efficacy of clinical care in patients with VTE.

Use of Metabolomic Profiling to Understand Variability in Adiposity Changes Following an Intentional Weight Loss Intervention in Older Adults	NUTRIENTS			English	Article						metabolomics; weight loss; body composition; aging; heterogeneity	DIETARY-PROTEIN INTAKE; BODY-COMPOSITION; INSULIN-RESISTANCE; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; VISCERAL FAT; AMINO-ACIDS; OBESITY; OVERWEIGHT; RESTRICTION; INDIVIDUALS	Inter-individual response to dietary interventions remains a major challenge to successful weight loss among older adults. This study applied metabolomics technology to identify small molecule signatures associated with a loss of fat mass and overall weight in a cohort of older adults on a nutritionally complete, high-protein diet. A total of 102 unique metabolites were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) for 38 adults aged 65-80 years randomized to dietary intervention and 36 controls. Metabolite values were analyzed in both baseline plasma samples and samples collected following the six-month dietary intervention to consider both metabolites that could predict the response to diet and those that changed in response to diet or weight loss.Eight metabolites changed over the intervention at a nominally significant level: D-pantothenic acid, L-methionine, nicotinate, aniline, melatonin, deoxycarnitine, 6-deoxy-L-galactose, and 10-hydroxydecanoate. Within the intervention group, there was broad variation in the achieved weight-loss and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-defined changes in total fat and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass. Change in the VAT mass was significantly associated with the baseline abundance of alpha-aminoadipate (p = 0.0007) and an additional mass spectrometry peak that may represent D-fructose, myo-inositol, mannose, alpha-D-glucose, allose, D-galactose, D-tagatose, or L-sorbose (p = 0.0001).

For this reason, to avoid risks to humans and environmental health, regulatory legislation and guidelines have been established based on extensive toxicological data. However, most of what is known in this field come from works on microcystin (MC) variants, which effects were almost exclusively tested in metazoan models. In this work, we used acute end-point toxicological assays and high-resolution hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer coupled with electrospray ionization source (ESI-Q-TOF-MS) analyses to evaluate the deleterious impact of aqueous extracts prepared from cultures of cyanobacteria and environmental bloom biomasses over a non-metazoan model organism, the cosmopolitan fresh/brackish water unicellular microeukaryote, Paramecium caudatum (Ciliophora). Our data suggest that all extracts produced time-dependent effects on P. caudatum survival, irrespective of their metabolite profile; and that this ciliate is more sensitive to extracts containing microginins than to extracts with only MCs, stressing that more toxicological investigations should be performed on the environmental impact of neglected cyanotoxins. Further, our data provide evidence that P. caudatum may be more sensitive to cyanotoxins than vertebrates, indicating that guidelines values, set on metazoans are likely to be inaccurate to protect organisms from basal food web positions. Thus, we highly recommend the widespread use of microeukaryotes, such as ciliates in environmental risk assessment frameworks for the establishment of more reliable cyanotoxin monitoring guideline values.

Immune response in probiotic-fed New Zealand black-footed abalone (Haliotis iris) under Vibrio splendidus challenge	FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						Haliotis iris; Vibriosis; Probiotics; Haemocytes; Metabolomics; Immunostimulation	DISEASE RESISTANCE; PERNA-CANALICULUS; PARAHAEMOLYTICUS; DIVERSICOLOR; DISCUS; GROWTH; INFECTION; APOPTOSIS; STRESS; LARVAE	Vibriosis disease is a major constraint for sustainable molluscan aquaculture. Development of strategies to enhance disease resistance during grow out would greatly reduce stock mortality and boost production yields. In this study, New Zealand black-footed abalone (Haliotis iris) were fed a commercial diet enhanced with multi-strain probiotics (Exiguobacterium JHEb1, Vibrio JH1 and Enterococcus JHLDc) for four months, then challenged with an injection of pathogenic Vibrio splendidus. Host immune responses in haemocytes were characterized using flow cytometry by measuring total haemocyte counts (THC) and viability, degree of apoptosis, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 48 h post-challenge. Probiotic-fed abalone had significantly higher survival rates compared to control animals after the bacterial challenge. Infected probiotic-fed abalone also had significantly higher haemocyte viabilities, slightly lower proportions of haemocytes undergoing early apoptosis, and lower proportions of ROS-producing haemocytes compared to infected control-fed abalone. In addition, metabolite profiles of muscle tissues generated via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) delivered complimentary evidence to support a perturbed ROS-regulatory system in infected abalone through changes in key metabolites associated with glutathione biosynthesis. The results of this study provide valuable information to assist in farm management practices, leading to enhance production and sustainability of the New Zealand abalone aquaculture industry.

Spectroscopic and Chromatographic Fingerprints for Discrimination of Specialty and Traditional Coffees by Integrated Chemometric Methods	FOOD ANALYTICAL METHODS			English	Article						Specialty coffee; Statistical mixture design; Factor analysis; UV-vis; Infrared; Chromatography	INFRARED-SPECTROSCOPY; ROASTED COFFEE; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; ARABICA; QUALITY; CULTIVARS; ACID; OPTIMIZATION; ATTRIBUTES; BEANS	Classification of specialty coffees is based mainly on sensory qualities that demand high training and onerous analysis of baristas. The consumption of specialty coffees has been growing owing to consumers' preference for better quality products. This work reports an integrated approach of sample preparation (statistical mixture design), instrumental techniques (spectroscopy and chromatography), and multivariate analysis (exploratory factor analysis) to discriminate specialty and traditional roasted commercial coffees, previously classified by the SCA (Specialty Coffee Association) cupping method. Factor analysis indicated that the fingerprint spectra obtained with aqueous and dichloromethane extracts provided the most divergent metabolite information. Aqueous extract promoted better discrimination for specialty and traditional coffee. Among the techniques used, chromatographic separation and UV-vis spectrophotometry detected metabolites that discriminated the coffees. The mid-infrared fingerprint showed lower discrimination between coffees. Factor loadings indicated that secondary metabolites related to better beverage quality correlate with the specialty coffees. The main metabolites responsible for discriminations were chlorogenic acids, trigonelline, organic acids, lipids, and fatty acids. This study presents for the first time the differentiation of traditional and specialty commercial coffee, using different analytical techniques, through its metabolomic profiles integrated with chemometric tools. These results highlight an alternative method of metabolomic approach for specialty coffee classification.

Characterization of Secondary Metabolites in Flowers of Sanguisorba officinalis L. by HPLC-DAD-MSn and GC/MS	CHEMISTRY & BIODIVERSITY			English	Article						Sanguisorba officinalis; anthocyanins; phenolics; amines; gas chromatography	MERCURIALIS PERENNIS L.; PHENOLIC-COMPOUNDS; ROSACEAE/ASTERACEAE FAMILY; LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; ETHANOL EXTRACTS; ZIYUGLYCOSIDE-I; SANGUIIN H-6; ESI-MS/MS; POLYSACCHARIDE; IDENTIFICATION	The investigations reported here focus on an in-depth characterization of the secondary metabolite profile of Sanguisorba officinalis flowers. For this purpose, fresh flowers were extracted with MeOH/H2O and EtOH/H2O and the resulting crude extracts fractionated using CH2Cl2, AcOEt, and BuOH. Individual compounds were characterized by high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometric detection (HPLC-DAD-MSn and GC/MS). MeOH/H2O extraction and LC/MSn investigations revealed the occurrence of flavonoid glycosides (quercetin, kaempferol), ellagitannin glycosides and four anthocyanins. Among the latter, two components, i. e., cyanidin-malonyl-glucose and cyanidin-galloyl-hexose, have not been reported for S. officinalis so far. Furthermore, phenylethylamine was characterized for the first time in Sanguisorba by pH value dependent extraction with CH2Cl2. In addition, AcOEt and BuOH extracts were analyzed by GC/MS both prior to and after acid hydrolysis of secondary metabolites. For this purpose, the extracts were treated with 1 n HCl solution (105 degrees C, 1 h) and derivatized with BSTFA. Analyses revealed the occurrence of several classes of phenolic compounds, such as gallic acid, hydroxybenzoic acid, hydroxycinnamic acid and ellagic acid derivatives. Additionally, the most prominent ursane-type triterpenoid (ziyu-glycoside I) from Sanguisorba and its corresponding aglycone isomers were detected and assigned based on their characteristic fragmentation patterns.

Two types of human plasma samples were split into two batches and analyzed in two individual labs for untargeted GC-MS metabolomic profiling. The two labs used the same silylation sample preparation protocols but different instrumentation, data processing software, and database. There were 55 metabolites annotated reproducibly, independent of the labs. The median coefficient variations (CV%) of absolute spectra ion intensities in both labs were less than 30%. However, the comparison of normalized ion intensity among biological groups, were inconsistent across labs. Predicted power based on annotated metabolites was evaluated post various normalization, data transformation and scaling. For the first time our study reveals the numerical details about the variations in metabolomic annotation and relative quantification using plain inter-laboratory GC-MS untargeted metabolomic approaches. Especially we compare several commonly used post-acquisition strategies and found normalization could not strengthen the annotation accuracy or relative quantification precision of untargeted approach, instead it will impact future experimental design. Standardization of untargeted metabolomics protocols, including sample preparation, instrumentation, data processing, etc., is critical for comparison of untargeted data across labs.

However, little is known about red light-induced metabolite and enzyme activities. In this study, pitaya fruit was treated with 100 Lux red light for 24 h. Red light irradiation significantly attenuated the variation trend of senescence traits, such as the decrease of total soluble solid (TSS) and TSS/acidity (titratable acidity, TA) ratio, the increase of TA, and respiratory rate. In addition, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) related characters, primary metabolites profiling, and volatile compounds profiling were determined. A total of 71 primary metabolites and 67 volatile compounds were detected and successfully identified by using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Red light irradiation enhanced glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, aldehydes metabolism, and antioxidant enzymes activities at early stage of postharvest storage, leading to the reduction of H2O2, soluble sugars, organic acids, and C-6 and C-7 aldehydes. At a later stage of postharvest storage, a larger number of resistance-related metabolites and enzyme activities were induced in red light-treated pitaya peel, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging, reducing power, fatty acids, and volatile aroma.

PCC 7338 (hereafter referred to as Synechocystis 7338) is a marine cyanobacterium that has the potential to produce photosynthetic pigments. In this study, we investigated the effects of various NaCl concentrations (0, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 M) on cell growth, photosynthetic pigments, and metabolites and intact lipid species profiles in Synechocystis 7338. The overall growth pattern of Synechocystis 7338 was similar under 0, 0.4, and 0.8 M NaCl conditions. Cell growth was retarded after reaching the exponential phase under 1.2 M NaCl; however, a similar growth pattern was observed after the exponential phase under 0.4 M NaCl (control group). The highest production of chlorophyll a (4.18 mg L-1), allophycocyanin (4.08 mg L-1), and phycoerythrin (1.70 mg L-1) were achieved under 1.2 M NaCl conditions. Altered metabolic and lipidomic profiles were observed at different NaCl conditions; significantly increased relative yields of glucosylglycerol, one diacylglyceryltrimethylhomoserine, one monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, and four phosphatidylglycerol species were observed under 1.2 M NaCl conditions using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and direct infusion-mass spectrometry analyses. In addition, it was revealed that the photosynthetic activity recovered under 1.2 M NaCl conditions in long-term culture. Hydrogen peroxide content significantly increased under 1.2 M NaCl conditions. It is believed that glutathione content also significantly increased under high salinity conditions to retain the normal functioning of Synechocystis 7338. These results indicate that high salinity conditions for Synechocystis 7338 culture could be used for the large-scale production of chlorophyll a, allophycocyanin, phycoerythrin, and other bioactive metabolites.

We measured 21 different AAs and 10 BAs in a sample of antipsychotic (AP)-naive first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients (n=52) at baseline, after 0.6-year as well as after 5.1-year treatment compared to control subjects (CSs, n=37). Serum levels of metabolites were determined with AbsoluteIDQ p180 kit using flow injection analysis tandem mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography technique. Elevated level of taurine and reduced level of proline and alpha-aminoadipic acid (alpha-AAA) were established as metabolites with significant change in AP-naive FEP patients compared to CSs. The following 0.6-year treatment restored these alterations. However, further continuous 5.1-year AP treatment changed the metabolic profile substantially. Significantly elevated levels of asparagine, glutamine, methionine, ornithine and taurine, alongside with decreased levels of aspartate, glutamate and alpha-AAA were observed in the patient group compared to CSs. These biomolecule profile alterations provide further insights into the pathophysiology of SCH spectrum disorders and broaden our understanding of the impact of AP treatment in the early stages of the disease.

Early metabolic priming under differing carbon sufficiency conditions influences peach fruit quality development	PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Crop load; Fruit quality; Gas chromatography mass spectrometry; Metabolomics; Non-targeted metabolomic analysis; Near-infrared spectroscopy; Priming; Prunus persica	ORGANIC-ACID; CROP LOAD; MEDICAGO-SATIVA; WATER-STRESS; APPLE FRUIT; REVEALS; MATURATION; GROWTH; SUGAR; ANNOTATION	Crop load management is an important preharvest factor to balance yield, quality, and maturation in peach. However, few studies have addressed how preharvest factors impact metabolism on fruit of equal maturity. An experiment was conducted to understand how carbon competition impacts fruit internal quality and metabolism in 'Cresthaven' peach trees by imposing distinct thinning severities. Fruit quality was evaluated at three developmental stages (52, 53, 54), while controlling for equal maturity using non-destructive visual to near-infrared spectroscopy. Non-targeted metabolite profiling was used to characterize fruit at each developmental stage from trees that were unthinned (carbon starvation) or thinned (carbon sufficiency). Carbon sufficiency resulted in significantly higher fruit dry matter content and soluble solids concentration at harvest when compared to the carbon starved, underscoring the true impact of carbon manipulation on fruit quality. Significant differences in the fruit metabolome between treatments were observed at 52 when phenotypes were similar, while less differences were observed at 54 when the carbon sufficient fruit exhibited a superior phenotype. This suggests a potential metabolic priming effect on fruit quality when carbon is sufficiently supplied during early fruit growth and development. In particular, elevated levels of catechin may suggest a link between secondary/primary metabolism and fruit quality development.

In this study, we investigate the metabolomics profile of patients affected by relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS)and primary progressive MS (PPMS), in order to find potential biomarkers to distinguish between the two forms. Methods: Cerebrospinal Fluid CSF and blood samples of 34 patients (RRMS n = 22, PPMS n = 12) were collected. Nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1-NMR) and mass spectrometry (coupled with a gas chromatography and liquid chromatography) were used as analytical techniques. Subsequently, a multivariate statistical analysis was performed; the resulting significant variables underwent U-Mann-Whitney test and correction for multiple comparisons. Receiver Operating Characteristic ROC curves were built and the pathways analysis was conducted. Results: The analysis of the serum and the CSF of the two classes, allowed the identification of several altered metabolites (lipids, biogenic amines, and amino acids). The pathways analysis indicated the following pathways were affected: Glutathione metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, glutamine-glutamate metabolism, arginine-ornithine metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis etc. Conclusion: The analysis allowed the identification of a set of metabolites able to classify RRMS and PPMS patients, each of whom express different patterns of metabolites in the two biofluids.

Different amplitudes of temperature fluctuation induce distinct transcriptomic and metabolomic responses in the dung beetle Phanaeus vindex	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Coleoptera; Histones; Insects; Metabolism; Temperature variation; Thermal physiology	GENE-EXPRESSION; JENSENS INEQUALITY; INSECT; RECONSTRUCTION; FAT; CARBOHYDRATE; ACCLIMATION; LIPOPHORIN; GENERATION; ALLOCATION	Most studies exploring molecular and physiological responses to temperature have focused on constant temperature treatments. To gain a better understanding of the impact of fluctuating temperatures, we investigated the effects of increased temperature variation on Phanaeus vindex dung beetles across levels of biological organization. Specifically, we hypothesized that increased temperature variation is energetically demanding. We predicted that thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate and energetic reserves would be reduced with increasing fluctuation. To test this, we examined the responses of dung beetles to constant (20 degrees C), low fluctuation (20 +/- 5 degrees C), or high fluctuation (20 +/- 12 degrees C) temperature treatments using respirometry, assessment of energetic reserves and HPLC-MS-based metabolomics. We found no significant differences in metabolic rate or energetic reserves, suggesting increased fluctuations were not energetically demanding. To understand why there was no effect of increased amplitude of temperature fluctuation on energetics, we assembled and annotated a de novo transcriptome, finding non-overlapping transcriptomic and metabolomic responses of beetles exposed to different fluctuations. We found that 58 metabolites increased in abundance in both fluctuation treatments, but 15 only did so in response to high-amplitude fluctuations. We found that 120 transcripts were significantly upregulated following acclimation to any fluctuation, but 174 were upregulated only in beetles from the high-amplitude fluctuation treatment. Several differentially expressed transcripts were associated with post-translational modifications to histones that support a more open chromatin structure. Our results demonstrate that acclimation to different temperature fluctuations is distinct and may be supported by increasing transcriptional plasticity. Our results indicate for the first time that histone modifications may underlie rapid acclimation to temperature variation.

To further elucidate the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and the preventive mechanism of GSD on glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) rats, a rapid and comprehensive H-1 NMR metabolomics method was established to detect urinary metabolic profiles in the control group, model group and GSD treatment group in this study. The orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was performed to investigate changes in the metabolites, and related metabolic pathways were discovered using MetaboAnalyst platform. As a result, a total of 27 differential metabolites were identified. Of these, 17 metabolites such as formate, allantoin and L-threonate were newly discovered as GIOP potential biomarkers. Energy metabolism, intestinal flora metabolism, amino acid metabolism and oxidative stress response were significantly changed in the urinary profiles of GIOP rats, and GSD could play an anti-osteoporosis role by regulating these metabolic pathways. This study compliments the earlier LC-MS based urine metabolomics research, and helps further understand the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and the potential preventive effects of GSD on GIOP rats.

Derivation of a metabolic signature associated with bacterial meningitis in infants	PEDIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article							CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; NEONATAL MENINGITIS; LUMBAR PUNCTURE; DIAGNOSIS; SEPSIS; ACID; CHALLENGES; CONTRIBUTE; GLUTAMATE; NMDA	Background Diagnosis of bacterial meningitis (BM) is challenging in newborn infants. Presently, biomarkers of BM have limited diagnostic accuracy. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metabolites may be a useful diagnostic tool in BM. Methods In a nested case-control study, we examined >400 metabolites in CSF of uninfected infants and infants with culture-confirmed BM using gas and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Preterm and full-term infants in a Level III or IV Neonatal Intensive Care Unit were prospectively enrolled when evaluated for serious bacterial infection. Results Over 200 CSF metabolites significantly differed in uninfected infants and infants with BM. Using machine learning, we found that as few as 6 metabolites distinguished infants with BM from uninfected infants in this pilot cohort. Further analysis demonstrated three metabolites associated with Group B Streptococcal meningitis. Conclusions We report the first comprehensive metabolic analysis of CSF in infants with BM. In our pilot cohort, we derived a metabolic signature that predicted the presence or absence of BM, irrespective of gestational age, postnatal age, sex, race and ethnicity, presence of neurosurgical hardware, white blood cell count in CSF, and red blood cell contamination in CSF. Metabolic analysis may aid diagnosis of BM and facilitate clinical decision-making in infants. Impact In a pilot cohort, metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid distinguished infants with bacterial meningitis from uninfected infants. We report the first comprehensive metabolic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid in infants with bacterial meningitis. Our findings may be used to improve diagnosis of bacterial meningitis and to offer mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of bacterial meningitis in infants.

To fully understand its mechanism of action, it is necessary to investigate the in vitro and in vivo metabolic profiles. For in vitro metabolism, H3B-6545 (50 mu M) was incubated with the hepatocytes of rat and human for 2 h. For in vivo metabolism H3B-6545 was orally administered to rats at a single dose of 10 mg/kg, and plasma, urine and fecal samples were then collected. All samples were analyzed by using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography combined with linear ion trap-orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap-MS) operated in positive ion mode. The structures of the metabolites were elucidated by comparing their MS and MS2 spectra with those of parent drug. A total of 11 metabolites, including a GSH adduct, were detected and structurally identified. M2, M7 and M8 were further unambiguously identified by using reference standards. Among these metabolites, M1, M5, M7 and M10 were newly found and reported for the first time. The metabolic pathways of H3B-6545 included deamination (M8 and M9), dealkylation (M2, M3 and M10), N-hydroxylation (M6), hydroxylation (M1 and M4), formation of amide derivatives (M5 and M7) and GSH conjugation (G1).

UHPLC-MS-Based Lipidomic and Metabonomic Investigation of the Metabolic Phenotypes of Wild Type and Hepatic CYP Reductase Null (HRN) Mice	JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOMEDICAL ANALYSIS			English	Article						Metabolic phenotyping; Cytochrome P450; lipid metabolism; bile acids	HPLC-MS; CYTOCHROME-P450; MOUSE	Hepatic cytochrome P450 reductase (EC 1.6.2.4, POR) deficient mice provide a useful means of investigating liver-related CYP450 drug metabolism. However, the organ-wide inactivation of CYP450s has wide ranging effects on liver physiology. Untargeted UHPLC-MS metabolic and lipid profiling of aqueous and organic solvent extracts has been employed to compare the metabolic phenotypes of livers obtained from either wild type (C57B16) or hepatic P450 reductase null (HRN (TM)) mice. The metabolic phenotyping of polar aqueous extracts revealed differences between wild type and HRN (TM) mice for bile acids with taurochendeoxycholic acid, and tauroursodeoxycholic acid increased in proportion in the latter and taurocholic acid reduced.

Temperate Propolis Has Anti-Inflammatory Effects and Is a Potent Inhibitor of Nitric Oxide Formation in Macrophages	METABOLITES			English	Article						propolis; pro; and anti-inflammatory cytokines; LPS stimulation; bone marrow derived macrophages; metabolomics	ACTIVATED RECEPTOR-GAMMA; FLAVONOIDS; IMMUNOMETABOLISM; METHYLGLYOXAL; CHILDREN; ACID; CELL	Previous research has shown that propolis has immunomodulatory activity. Extracts from two UK propolis samples were assessed for their anti-inflammatory activities by investigating their ability to alter the production of the cytokines: tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, and IL-10 from mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages co-stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The propolis extracts suppressed the secretion of IL-1 beta and IL-6 with less effect on TNF alpha. In addition, propolis reduced the levels of nitric oxide formed by LPS-stimulated macrophages. Metabolomic profiling was carried out by liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) on a ZIC-pHILIC column. LPS increased the levels of intermediates involved in nitric oxide biosynthesis; propolis lowered many of these. In addition, LPS produced an increase in itaconate and citrate, and propolis treatment increased itaconate still further while greatly reducing citrate levels. Moreover, LPS treatment increased levels of glutathione (GSH) and intermediates in its biosynthesis, while propolis treatment boosted these still further. In addition, propolis treatment greatly increased levels of uridine diphosphate (UDP)-sugar conjugates. Overall, the results showed that propolis extracts exert an anti-inflammatory effect by the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and by the metabolic reprogramming of LPS activity in macrophages.

However, the existence of mutual interaction between scion and rootstock is often neglected. To explore the origin of different fruit quality traits in citrus, we studied the effect of rootstock and the reciprocal interaction between scion and rootstock of nine combinations; three mandarin varieties grafted on three different rootstocks. We analyzed the metabolic profile of juice via gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS and LCMS, respectively). Additionally, we profiled phloem sap composition in the scion and the rootstock. Quality traits of fruit and their physio-chemical characteristics were also evaluated. Results For all three cultivars, rootstock was found to affect fruit yield and biochemical fruit quality parameters (sugar and acidity) in interactions with the scions. In mandarin juice, eight of 48 compounds (two primary and six secondary) were related directly to the rootstock, and another seven (one primary and six secondary) were interactively affected by scion and rootstock. In scion and rootstock sap, six and 14 of 53 and 55 primary metabolites, respectively, were directly affected by the rootstock, while 42 and 33 were affected by rootstock interactively with scion, respectively. Conclusion In this work, we show for the first time a reciprocal effect between rootstock and scion. Based on our results, the scion and rootstock interaction might be organ, distance or time dependent.

Resistant starch 3 (RS3), as a starch resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis owing to its special structure, has a good effect on improving insulin resistance and reducing blood sugar in T2DM patients. However, the possible mechanisms were barely interpreted yet. In our research, we aimed to evaluate the effects and the possible mechanisms of RS3 on the treatment of T2DM. ICR mice treated with high-fat diet (HFD) for eight weeks, and then injected with streptozotocin (STZ) (100 mg/kg) to establish the T2DM. We choose the mice with the fast blood glucose (FBG) more than 11 mmol/L as T2DM. After treated for 11 weeks the relevant data was analyzed. According to the results, the FBG was dramatically reduced (p < 0.05), which also downregulated triglyceride (p < 0.01) and total cholesterol (p < 0.01). Additionally, the insulin resistance indexes were significantly reduced (p < 0.01), the homeostasis model assessment-j3 and insulin-sensitive index were significantly im proved (p < 0.01) in RS3 group. Meanwhile, the metabolic profiles of urine were analyzed and 29 potential biomarkers were screened out, including amino acids and lipids. In conclusion, we speculated that the tricarboxylic acid cycle, amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism played roles in the therapeutic mechanisms of RS3 on T2DM.

Here, we investigated the influence of gastrectomy for gastric cancer on the gut microbiome and metabolome, and how it related to postgastrectomy conditions. Design We performed shotgun metagenomics sequencing and capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry-based metabolomics analyses on faecal samples collected from participants with a history of gastrectomy for gastric cancer (n=50) and compared them with control participants (n=56). Results The gut microbiota in the gastrectomy group showed higher species diversity and richness (p<0.05), together with greater abundance of aerobes, facultative anaerobes and oral microbes. Moreover, bile acids such as genotoxic deoxycholic acid and branched-chain amino acids were differentially abundant between the two groups (linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe): p<0.05, q<0.1, LDA>2.0), as were also Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes modules involved in nutrient transport and organic compounds biosynthesis (LEfSe: p<0.05, q<0.1, LDA>2.0). Conclusion Our results reveal alterations of gut microbiota after gastrectomy, suggesting its association with postoperative comorbidities. The multi-omic approach applied in this study could complement the follow-up of patients after gastrectomy.

In our previous study, we found that supplementation with low concentration of ouabain during pregnancy could restore glomerulus numbers at birth, rescuing kidney development. However, the metabolic pattern of kidney in IUGR offspring and the effect of ouabain have not been evaluated. Main methods: In this study, based on GC-MS and LC-MS platforms, we used the protein restriction rat model to explore the molecular mechanisms of kidney damage induced by IUGR and the protective effect of ouabain. Key findings: The results showed that malnutrition could induce IUGR in rat offspring at the 20th gestational day but ouabain treatment could partially reverse the body and kidney weight loss. Ouabain treatment could upregulate arginine, N-acetylornithine and carbamoyl phosphate as well as adenine nucleotide and guanine nucleotide downregulated by low-protein diet. Moreover, six metabolites were identified to be significantly correlated with fetal kidney weight, with 3 metabolites involved in arginine metabolism (arginine, N-acetylornithine, urea) and UDP-glucuronate correlated positively, while lysine and anthranilate correlated negatively. Significance: The results suggested that the underlying mechanism of ouabain against renal maldevelopment involved the metabolic regulation, particularly the arginine metabolism, which played an important role in the development of fetal kidney.

Intracellular BCKAs are cleared by branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH), which is sensitive to inhibitory phosphorylation by BCKD kinase (BCKDK). Accumulation of BCKAs is an indicator of defective BCAA catabolism and has been correlated with glucose intolerance and cardiac dysfunction. However, it is unclear whether BCKAs directly alter insulin signaling and function in the skeletal and cardiac muscle cell. Furthermore, the role of excess fatty acids (FAs) in perturbing BCAA catabolism and BCKA availability merits investigation. By using immunoblotting and ultra-performance liquid chromatography MS/MS to analyze the hearts of fasted mice, we observed decreased BCAA-catabolizing enzyme expression and increased circulating BCKAs, but not BCAAs. In mice subjected to diet-induced obesity (DIO), we observed similar increases in circulating BCKAs with concomitant changes in BCAA-catabolizing enzyme expression only in the skeletal muscle. Effects of DIO were recapitulated by simulating lipotoxicity in skeletal muscle cells treated with saturated FA, palmitate. Exposure of muscle cells to high concentrations of BCKAs resulted in inhibition of insulin-induced AKT phosphorylation, decreased glucose uptake, and mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Altering intracellular clearance of BCKAs by genetic modulation of BCKDK and BCKDHA expression showed similar effects on AKT phosphorylation. BCKAs increased protein translation and mTORC1 activation. Pretreating cells with mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin restored BCKA's effect on insulin-induced AKT phosphorylation. This study provides evidence for FA-mediated regulation of BCAA-catabolizing enzymes and BCKA content and highlights the biological role of BCKAs in regulating muscle insulin signaling and function.

The biological effects of Cannabis have been attributed to phytocannabinoid modulation of the endocannabinoid system. In-vitro and in-vivo studies have shown that pure phytocannabinoids can alter the levels of endocannabinoids and other cannabimimetic lipids. However, it is not yet understood whether whole Cannabis extracts exert variable effects on the endocannabinoid metabolome, and whether these effects vary between tissues. To address these challenges, we have developed and validated a novel analytical approach, termed "cannabinoidomics," for the simultaneous extraction and analysis of both endogenous and plant cannabinoids from different biological matrices. In the methodological development liquid chromatography high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC/HRMS/MS) was used to identify 57 phytocannabinoids, 15 major phytocannabinoid metabolites, and 78 endocannabinoids and cannabimimetic lipids in different biological matrices, most of which have no analytical standards. In the validation process, spiked cannabinoids were quantified with acceptable selectivity, repeatability, reproducibility, sensitivity, and accuracy. The power of this analytical method is demonstrated by analysis of serum and four different sections of mouse brains challenged with three different cannabidiol (CBD)-rich extracts. The results demonstrate that variations in the minor phytocannabinoid contents of the different extracts may lead to varied effects on endocannabinoid concentrations, and on the CBD metabolite profile in the peripheral and central systems. We also show that the Cannabis challenge significantly decreases the levels of several endocannabinoids in specific brain sections compared to the control group.

Tomato Metabolic Changes in Response to Tomato-Potato Psyllid (Bactericera cockerelli) and Its Vectored Pathogen Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum	PLANTS-BASEL			English	Article						tomato; Bactericera cockerelli; Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum; UPLC; HR-QTOF-MS; HS-SPME; GC-MS; phenolics; hormones	GREEN LEAF VOLATILES; HEMIPTERA TRIOZIDAE; SALICYLIC-ACID; PSEUDOMONAS-SYRINGAE; BETA-IONONE; RESISTANCE; INFECTION; PLANTS; SUPPRESSION; EXPRESSION	The bacterial pathogen 'Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum' (Lso) is transmitted by the tomato potato psyllid (TPP), Bactericera cockerelli, to solanaceous crops. In the present study, the changes in metabolic profiles of insect-susceptible (cv CastleMart) and resistant (RIL LA3952) tomato plants in response to TPP vectoring Lso or not, were examined after 48 h post infestation. Non-volatile and volatile metabolites were identified and quantified using headspace solid-phase microextraction equipped with a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC-MS) and ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/ESI-HR-QTOFMS), respectively. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used to define the major uncorrelated metabolite components assuming the treatments as the correlated predictors. Metabolic changes in various classes of metabolites, including volatiles, hormones, and phenolics, were observed in resistant and susceptible plants in response to the insects carrying the pathogen or not. The results suggest the involvement of differentially regulated and, in some cases, implicates antagonistic metabolites in plant defensive signaling. Upon validation, the identified metabolites could be used as markers to screen and select breeding lines with enhanced resistance to reduce economic losses due to the TPP-Lso vector-pathogen complex in Solanaceous crops.

The metabolites were separated and identified on C18 column (100 mm x 2.1 mm, 1.7 mu m) and Amide column (100 mm x 2.1 mm, 1.7 mu m) using the UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). As a result, a total of 40 differential metabolites were identified, which were mainly related to lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism and intestinal flora metabolism. Ifs worth mentioning that some new potential biomarkers associated with osteoporosis such as 3-hdroxybutyric acid and glycocholic acid were discovered in this study for the first time. With pattern recognition analysis of metabolite profile, a clear separation of the model group and the control group was acquired for plasma samples. The GSD group showed a predisposition towards recovery mimicking the control group, which was in agreement with the behavioral and biochemical results. The present study suggested that GSD had significant anti-osteoporotic effects on glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis rat plasma, which might be attributed to regulating multiple metabolic pathways. Thus, metabolomics would be a useful tool in the evaluation of the efficacy and elucidation of the mechanism underlying the complex traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions.

Herein, an in situ metabolomics method based on air flow-assisted desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (AFADESI-MSI) was established for direct analysis of metabolites in renal tissue sections. This method was subsequently applied to investigate spatially resolved metabolic profile changes in rat kidney after the administration of aristolochic acid I, a known nephrotoxic drug, aimed to discover metabolites associated with nephrotoxicity. As a result, 38 metabolites related to the arginine-creatinine metabolic pathway, the urea cycle, the serine synthesis pathway, metabolism of lipids, choline, histamine, lysine, and adenosine triphosphate were significantly changed in the group treated with aristolochic acid I. These metabolites exhibited a unique distribution in rat kidney and a good spatial match with histopathological renal lesions. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying aristolochic acids nephrotoxicity and demonstrates that AFADESI-MSI-based in situ metabolomics is a promising technique for investigation of the molecular mechanism of drug toxicity.

Protocols commonly used for liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based FFPE metabolomics have not been optimized for lipidomic analysis and pre-analytical factors, that potentially affect metabolite levels, were scarcely investigated. We here demonstrate the assessment and optimization of sample preparation procedures for comprehensive metabolomic and lipidomic profiling in FFPE kidney tissue by LC-QTOF-MS. The optimized protocol allows improved monitoring of lipids including ceramides (Cer), glycosphingolipids (GSL) and triglycerides (TAGs) while the profiling capability for small polar molecules is maintained. Further, repeatable sample preparation (CVs < 20%) along with high analytical (CVs < 10%) and inter-day precision (CVs < 20%) is achieved. As proof of concept, we analyzed a set of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and corresponding non-tumorous FFPE tissue samples, achieving phenotypic distinction. Investigation of the impact of tissue fixation time (6 h, 30 h and 54 h) on FFPE tissue metabolic profiles revealed metabolite class-dependent differences on their detection abundance. Whereas specific lipids (e.g. phosphatidylinositoles, GSLs, saturated fatty acids and saturated lyso-phosphatidytlethanolamines LPED remained largely unaffected (CVs < 20% between groups of fixation time), neutral lipids (e.g. Cer and TAGs) exhibited high variability (CVs > 80%). Strikingly, out of the lipid classes assigned as unaffected, fatty acids 18:0, 16:0 and LPE 18:0 were detectable by high-resolution MALDI-FT-ICR MS imaging in an independent cohort of ccRCC tissues (n = 64) and exhibited significant differences between tumor and non-tumor regions.

Recent data regarding the chemical constituents and biological activities of Aquilaria leaves led us to attempt to qualitatively profile the metabolites of Aquilaria malaccensis leaves from a healthy, noninoculated tree through phytochemical screening, GC-MS, and LC/Q-TOF-MS. The present work is also the first to report the antilipoxygenase activity of A. malaccensis leaves from healthy noninoculated tree and investigate its toxicity on oral mucosal cells. A total of 53 compounds were tentatively identified in the extract, some of which have been described in literature as exhibiting anti-inflammatory activity. A number of compounds were identified for the first time in the extract of A. malaccensis leaf, including quercetin, quercetin-O-hexoside, kaempferol-O-dirhamnoside, isorhamnetin-O-hexoside, syringetin-O-hexoside, myricetin, tetrahydroxyflavanone, hesperetin, sissotrin, and lupeol. The antilipoxygenase assay was used to determine the lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitory potential of the extract, while a WST-1 assay was conducted to investigate the effect of the extract on oral epithelial cells (OEC). The extract implied moderate anti-LOX activity with IC50 value of 71.6 mu g/mL. Meanwhile, the cell viability of OEC ranged between 92.55% (10 mu g/mL)-76.06% +/- (100 mu g/mL) upon treatment, indicating some potential toxicity risks. The results attained encourage future studies of the isolation of bioactive compounds from Aquilaria malaccensis leaves, as well as further investigation on the anti-inflammatory mechanisms and toxicity associated with their use.

Bioactive lipids are main drivers of these processes. In vitro mechanistic studies of bioactive lipids have been largely based on two-dimensional endothelial cell cultures that, due to lack of laminar flow and the growth of the cells on noncompliant stiff substrates, often display a pro-inflammatory phenotype. This complicates the assessment of inflammatory processes. Three-dimensional microvessels-on-a-chip models provide a unique opportunity to generate endothelial microvessels in a more physiological environment. Using an optimized targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry measurements of a panel of pro- and anti-inflammatory bioactive lipids, we measure the profile changes upon administration of TNF alpha. We demonstrate that bioactive lipid profiles can be readily detected from three-dimensional microvessels-on-a-chip and display a more dynamic, less inflammatory response to TNF alpha, that resembles more the human situation, compared to classical two-dimensional endothelial cell cultures.

However, the metabolomic analysis of patients with uveitis has not yet been conducted. Here, we profiled the serum metabolomes of patients with three major forms of uveitis (Behs disease (BD), sarcoidosis, and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (VKH)) to identify potential biomarkers. This study included 19 BD, 20 sarcoidosis, and 15 VKH patients alongside 16 healthy control subjects. The metabolite concentrations in their sera were quantified using liquid chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The discriminative abilities of quantified metabolites were evaluated by four comparisons: control vs. three diseases, and each disease vs. the other two diseases (such as sarcoidosis vs. BD + VKH). Among 78 quantified metabolites, 24 kinds of metabolites showed significant differences in these comparisons. Four multiple logistic regression models were developed and validated. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) in the model to discriminate disease groups from control was 0.72. The AUC of the other models to discriminate sarcoidosis, BD, and VKH from the other two diseases were 0.84, 0.83, and 0.73, respectively. This study provides potential diagnostic abilities of sarcoidosis, BD, and VKH using routinely available serum samples that can be collected with minimal invasiveness.

However, their associations with bone mineral density (BMD) have not been established in postmenopausal women. The present study investigates the relation of diet, the microbiota composition, and the serum metabolic profile in postmenopausal women with normal-BMD or with low-BMD. Ninety-two Mexican postmenopausal women were classified into normal-BMD (n = 34) and low-BMD (n = 58). The V4 hypervariable region was sequenced using the Miseq platform. Serum vitamin D was determined by chemiluminescence immunoassay. Serum concentrations of acyl-carnitines and amino acids were determined by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. Diet was assessed by a food frequency questionnaire. The low-BMD group had fewer observed species, higher abundance of gamma-Proteobacteria, lower consumption of lycopene, and lower concentrations of leucine, valine, and tyrosine compared with the normal-BMD group. These amino acids correlated positively with the abundance of Bacteroides. Lycopene consumption positively correlated with Oscillospira and negatively correlated with Pantoea genus abundance. Finally, the intestinal microbiota of women with vitamin D deficiency was related to Erysipelotrichaceae and Veillonellaceae abundance compared to the vitamin D non-deficient group. Associations mediated by the gut microbiota between diet and circulating metabolites with low-BMD were identified.

Here, we investigated the role and metabolism profile of polyphenols under aluminum (Al) stress in different lettuce genotypes grown in 0.5 mM CaCl2 solution with AlCl3 (pH = 4.5). The complementary use of high-resolution mass spectrometry and quantitative biochemical approaches allowed the characterization of total and unique phenols, as well as their roles in Al tolerance. By comparing the most tolerant and sensitive genotype, 8 polyphenols, including 4 phenolic acids, 2 flavonoids, 1 xanthone and 1 unknown compound, were identified in the roots of the tolerant genotype. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents significantly increased in the tolerant genotype under Al stress. Seedlings with more phenolic accumulation usually performed greater Al tolerance. Meanwhile, principal enzymes related to phenolic biosynthesis significantly increased in roots of the tolerance genotype after Al treatment, with phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, and 4-coumarate coenzyme A ligase increased by 16,18 and 30%, respectively. The elevated total phenolics were significantly suppressed by AIP, a highly specific PAL inhibitor. Consequently, the antioxidant capacity was inhibited, leading to lettuce sensitivity to Al stress. These results clearly suggested the enhancement of unique polyphenolic biosynthesis as an adaptive strategy of lettuce to Al stress by protecting plants from oxidative stress. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Consequently, biological activities become difficult to correlate to the presence/content of certain constituents. Herein, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) combined with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HR MS/MS) was successfully applied to six commercial GT products, extracted by ethanol sonication, to disclose their polyphenol profile beyond the well-known catechins. The relative abundance of each class of metabolites was correlated to antiradical and antilipoperoxidant data through hierarchical clustering analysis, since it reasonably affects the beneficial properties of the product that reaches the consumer. The thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay demonstrated that GT extracts effectively counteracted the UV-induced lipoperoxidation of hemp oil, which is highly rich in Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs), and therefore highly unstable. The Relative Antioxidant Capacity Index (RACI) comprehensively emphasized that gunpower and blend in filter GTs appeared to be the less active matrices, and except for a GT-based supplement, the Sencha GT, which was particularly rich in flavonol glycosides, was the most active, followed by Bancha GT.

The growing awareness on the close relationship between the dietary habits and this health disturbance has encouraged the development of new beverages using alternative sweeteners that could contribute to combat the above referred pathophysiological disorders. To gain further insight into this issue, the present work, upon an acute dietary intervention, evaluated the urinary excretion of flavanones ingested through polyphenols-rich beverages composed of maqui berry and citrus, with the aim of establishing the highest urinary excretion rate and metabolite profiles. The functional beverages evaluated were supplemented with a range of sweeteners including sucrose (natural and high caloric), stevia (natural and non-caloric), and sucralose (artificial and non-caloric) as an approach that would allow reducing the intake of sugars and provide bioactive phenolics (flavanones). The juices developed were ingested by volunteers (n = 20) and the resulting flavanones and their phase II metabolites in urine were analyzed by Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography ElectroSpray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS). A total of 16 metabolites were detected: eriodyctiol, naringenin, and homoeriodyctiol derivatives, where peak concentrations were attained 3.5 h after beverage intake. Sucralose and stevia were the sweeteners that provided the highest urinary excretion for most compounds. Sucrose did not provide a remarkable higher elimination through urine of any compounds in comparison with sucralose or stevia. These results propose two alternative sweeteners to sucrose (sucralose and stevia), an overused, high caloric sweetener that promotes some metabolic diseases.

Therefore, to further increase the utilization of green tea leaves, it is imperative to understand the distribution and variation of their secondary metabolites with respect to different harvesting times. This study compared the metabolomes of young leaves of 'Anji Baicha' between early spring tea and late spring tea in positive and negative ESI modes using UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF/MS. Potential biomarkers were selected by principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PIS-DA) of chemometrics methods. Results showed that the metabolic profiles of young leaves in early and late spring tea were significantly different. The metabolite-related pathways associated with these differences included those involved in biosynthesis of flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, flavone and flavonol, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. In early spring tea leaves, concentrations of amino acids (L-glutamine and L-tryptophan), (S)-( - )-limonene, most of the catechins, and flavonol/flavone glycosides were found to be significantly increased, while proanthocyanidins (proanthocyanidin A1, prodelphinidin A1, and prodelphinidin A(2) 3'-gallate) concentrations were significantly decreased. As a result of the metabolomics analysis of young leaves of green tea plants with respect to different harvesting time, information regarding physiological characteristics and optimal harvesting time was obtained.

Core collections have been constructed from conserved germplasm resources based on phenotypic traits and molecular markers. However, little is known about these collections' phytochemical properties. This study explored the chemical composition of male E. ulmoides flowers, in order to provide guidance in the quality control, sustainable cultivation, and directional breeding of this tree species. Methods: We assessed the male flowers from 22 core collections using ultra-performance liquid chromatography and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF/MS) non-targeted metabolomics, and analyzed them using multivariate statistical methods including principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). Results: We annotated a total of 451 and 325 metabolites in ESI+ and ESI- modes, respectively, by aligning the mass fragments of the secondary mass spectra with those in the database. Four chemotypes were well established using the ESI+ metabolomics data. Of the 29 screened biomarkers, 21, 6, 19, and 5 markers corresponded to chemotypes I, II, III, and IV, respectively. More than half of the markers belonged to flavonoid and amino acid derivative classes. Conclusion: Non-targeted metabolomics is a suitable approach to the chemotype classification and biomarker screening of male E. ulmoides flower core collections. We first evaluated the metabolite profiles and compositional variations of male E. ulmoides flowers in representative core collections before establishing possible chemotypes and significant biomarkers denoting the variations. We used genetic variations to infer the metabolite compositional variations of male E. ulmoides flower core collections instead of using the geographical origins of the germplasm resources. The newly proposed biomarkers sufficiently classified the chemotypes to be applied for germplasm resource evaluation.

Comparative analyses (univariate, multivariate, correlation, heatmaps, receiver operating characteristi curves) were performed between MMD patients and HCs. Twenty-five discriminating serum metabolic biomarkers between MMD patients and HCs were identified. Compared with HCs, MMD patients had higher levels of phenol, 2-hydroxybutyric acid, L-isoleucine, L-serine, glycerol, pelargonic acid, L-methionine, myristic acid, pyroglutamic acid, palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, stearic acid, octadecanamide, monoglyceride (MG) (16:0/0:0/0:0), and MG (0:0/18:0/0:0), and lower levels of L-alanine, L-valine, urea, succinic acid, L-phenylalanine, L-threonine, L-tyrosine, edetic acid, and oleamide. These metabolic biomarkers are involved in several pathways and are closely associated with the metabolism of amino acids, lipids, carbohydrates, and carbohydrate translation. A GC-MS-based metabolomics approach could be useful in the clinical diagnosis of MMD. The identified biomarkers may be helpful to develop an objective diagnostic method for MMD and improve our understanding of MMD pathogenesis.

Metabolomic Profiling After a Meal Shows Greater Changes and Lower Metabolic Flexibility in Cardiometabolic Diseases	JOURNAL OF THE ENDOCRINE SOCIETY			English	Article						cardiometabolic disease; metabolomics; metabolic health; meal challenge; postprandial state		Context: Metabolic flexibility is the physiologic acclimatization to differing energy availability and requirement states. Effectively maintaining metabolic flexibility remains challenging, particularly since metabolic dysregulations in meal consumption during cardiometabolic disease (CMD) pathophysiology are incompletely understood. Objective: We compared metabolic flexibility following consumption of a standardized meal challenge among adults with or without CMDs. Design, Setting, and Participants: Study participants (n = 349; age 37-54 years, 55% female) received a standardized meal challenge (520 kcal, 67.4 g carbohydrates, 24.3 g fat, 8.0 g protein; 259 mL). Blood samples were collected at baseline and 2 hours postchallenge. Plasma samples were assayed by high-resolution, nontargeted metabolomics with dual-column liquid chromatography and ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry. Metabolome-wide associations between features and meal challenge timepoint were assessed in multivariable linear regression models. Results: Sixty-five percent of participants had >= 1 of 4 CMDs: 33% were obese, 6% had diabetes, 39% had hypertension, and 50% had metabolic syndrome. Log(2)-normalized ratios of feature peak areas (postprandial:fasting) clustered separately among participants with versus without any CMDs. Among participants with CMDs, the meal challenge altered 1756 feature peak areas (1063 reversed-phase [C18], 693 hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography [HILIC]; all q < 0.05). In individuals without CMDs, the meal challenge changed 1383 feature peak areas (875 C18; 508 HILIC; all q < 0.05). There were 108 features (60 C18; 48 HILIC) that differed by the meal challenge and CMD status, including dipeptides, carnitines, glycerophospholipids, and a bile acid metabolite (all P < 0.05). Conclusions: Among adults with CMDs, more metabolomic features differed after a meal challenge, which reflected lower metabolic flexibility relative to individuals without CMDs.

However, the seasonal differences of blue hue of pigments have not been fully demonstrated. In this research, V. bracteatum Thumb. leaves were collected from eight months for metabolite analysis. The global metabolic profile in leaves was examined to distinguish the differential metabolites and monitor the dynamic changes. This research revealed that several discriminatory secondary metabolites were monotropein derivatives, flavonoid glycosides and chlorogenic acid isomers by LCMS-untargeted approach. The changes of monotropein derivatives and dimers occurred in a season-dependent manner which almost showed higher abundances in spring. Meanwhile, several free amino acids changed dramatically by HPLC-targeted measurement. Particularly, Ala, Glu, and Asp caused a positive impact on blue color. Ser, Arg, and His were negatively correlated with the color. This research provided the first evidence that the seasonal differences of blue pigment are ascribed to the systemic changes of monotropein derivatives and free amino acids in V. bracteatum Thunb. leaves.

Aqueous humor metabolite profile of pseudoexfoliation glaucoma is distinctive	MOLECULAR OMICS			English	Article							EXFOLIATION SYNDROME; PLASMA HOMOCYSTEINE; UNITED-STATES; VITAMIN-D; VARIANTS; ENHANCEMENT; ASSOCIATION; PENETRANCE; CATARACT; ARGININE	Pseudoexfoliation (PEX) is a known cause of secondary open angle glaucoma. PEX glaucoma is associated with structural and metabolic changes in the eye. Despite similarities, PEX and primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) may have differences in the composition of metabolites. We analyzed the metabolites of the aqueous humor (AH) of PEX subjects sequentially first using nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR: HSQC and TOCSY), and subsequently with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) implementing isotopic ratio outlier analysis (IROA) quantification. The findings were compared with previous results for POAG and control subjects analyzed using identical sequential steps. We found significant differences in metabolites between the three conditions. Principle component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) indicated clear grouping based on the metabolomes of the three conditions. We used machine learning algorithms and a percentage set of the data to train, and utilized a different or larger dataset to test whether a trained model can correctly classify the test dataset as PEX, POAG or control. Three different algorithms: linear support vector machines (SVM), deep learning, and a neural network were used for prediction. They all accurately classified the test datasets based on the AH metabolome of the sample. We next compared the AH metabolome with known AH and TM proteomes and genomes in order to understand metabolic pathways that may contribute to alterations in the AH metabolome in PEX. We found potential protein/gene pathways associated with observed significant metabolite changes in PEX.

Metabolomics is a potential strategy for breast cancer detection. The post-column infused internal standard (PCI-IS)-assisted liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method has been demonstrated as an effective strategy for quantitative metabolomics. In this study, we evaluated the performance of targeted metabolomics with the PCI-IS quantification method to identify women with breast cancer. Methods We used metabolite profiling to identify 17 dysregulated metabolites in breast cancer patients. Two LC/MS/MS methods in combination with the PCI-IS strategy were developed to quantify these metabolites in plasma samples. Detection models were built through the analysis of plasma samples from 176 subjects consisting of healthy volunteers and breast cancer patients. Results Three isotope standards were selected as the PCI-ISs for the metabolites. The accuracy was within 82.8-114.16%, except for citric acid and lactic acid at high concentration levels. The repeatability and intermediate precision were all lower than 15% relative standard deviation. We have identified several metabolites that indicate the presence of breast cancer. The area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve, sensitivity and specificity of the linear combinations of metabolite concentrations and age with the highest AUROC were 0.940 (0.889-0.992), 88.4% and 94.2% for pre-menopausal woman, respectively, and 0.828 (0.734-0.922), 73.5% and 85.1% for post-menopausal women, respectively. Conclusions The targeted metabolomics with PCI-IS quantification method successfully established prediction models for breast cancer detection. Further study is essential to validate these proposed markers.

Gut microbiota has been found to demethylate MeHg and promote the excretion of Hg through feces. However, the impacts of MeHg on gut microbiota and metabolites related to gut-brain interactions were less studied in mammals. The object of this study was to investigate the impacts of acute MeHg exposure on gut microbiome and metabolites together with its impact on gut integrity and related biological responses in rats. Rats were exposed to MeHg through oral administration and were sacrificed after 24 h 16 S rRNA gene sequencing was used to study the perturbance to gut microbiome and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used for metabolomics profiling. It was found that gut was one of the target tissues of MeHg. MeHg induce the changes of intestinal microbial community structure and induce the regulating neuron activity change of intestinal neurotransmitters and metabolites on intestinal neurotransmitters and metabolites regulating the neuron activity. This was supported by the increased BDNF level. These findings may suggest a potential new mechanism regarding the neurotoxicity of MeHg. The protocols used in this study may also be applied to understand the neurotoxicity of other environmental neurotoxins like Pb, Mn, polychlorinated biphenyls, and pesticides, etc and to screen the neurotoxicity of emerging environmental contaminants.

However, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms are complex and not completely understood. Here we utilized mass spectrometry to identify the global phosphorylation dynamics in hippocampus tissue in germ-free mice and specific pathogen-free mice (GF vs SPF), fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) model ("depression microbiota" and the "healthy microbiota" recipient mice). As a result, 327 phosphosites of 237 proteins in GF vs SPF, and 478 phosphosites of 334 proteins in "depression microbiota" vs "healthy microbiota" recipient mice were identified as significant. These phosphorylation dysregulations were consistently associated with glutamatergic neurotransmitter system disturbances. The FMT mice exhibited disturbances in lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism in both the periphery and brain through integrating phosphoproteomic and metabolomic analysis. Moreover, CAMKII-CREB signaling pathway, in response to these disturbances, was the primary common perturbed cellular process. In addition, we demonstrated that the spliceosome, never directly implicated in mental disorders previously, was a substantially neuronal function disrupted by gut microbiota dysbiosis, and the NCBP1 phosphorylation was identified as a novel pathogenic target. These results present a new perspective to study the pathologic mechanisms of gut microbiota dysbiosis related depression and highlight potential gut-mediated therapies for depression.

The pharmacokinetics and metabolism of gefitinib were investigated using a range of rapid UHPLC-MS and UHPLC-IM-HRMS methods, using both reversed-phase (RP) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC), to rapidly determine the drugs pharmacokinetics and metabolic fate. Rapid oral absorption resulted in peak plasma concentrations at 1 h of ca. 7 mu g/mL, that declined with a half-life of 3.8 h (2.6 h for the IV route), and providing an estimated oral bioavailability of 53%. Gefitinib itself was the major circulating drug-related compound in plasma extracts, with a total of 11 metabolites identified. The urinary profiles determined using both HILIC and RP-UPLC-IM-MS detected gefitinib and 10 metabolites or 15 metabolites respectively including the detection of a number of novel glucuronide conjugates. Despite rapid, sub 5 min, LC profiling methods being employed metabolite coverage was shown to be high and compared well with that of previous studies.

However, little is known about how gut microbes and metabolites are altered when lepidopteran pest species switch hosts. In the present study, using 16S-rDNA sequencing and mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, we analyzed the gut microbiota and metabolites of three populations ofPlutella xylostella: one feeding on radish (PxR) and two feeding on peas (PxP; with PxP-1 and PxP-17 being the first and 17th generations after host shift from radish to peas, respectively). We found that the diversity of gut microbes in PxP-17 was significantly lower than those in PxR and PxP-1, which indicates a distinct change in gut microbiota after host shift. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis revealed that the functions of energy metabolism, signal transduction, and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism were increased in PxP-17, suggesting their potential roles in host adaptation. Metabolic profiling showed a significant difference in the abundance of gut metabolites between PxR and PxP-17, and significant correlations of gut bacteria with gut metabolites. These findings shed light on the interaction among plants, herbivores, and symbionts, and advance our understanding of host adaptation associated with gut bacteria and metabolic activities inP. xylostella.

J	Yan, QH; Mao, HL; Guan, JY				Yan Qinghua; Mao Huili; Guan Jianyi			Metabolomics analysis reveals the mechanisms of the effect of Sijunzi decoction on spleen deficiency syndrome in a rat model	MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Sijunzi decoction (SJZD); Spleen deficiency syndrome; Metabolomics; Mechanism	PATHWAY ANALYSIS; CELLS; MS; IDENTIFICATION; METABOANALYST; ELUCIDATION; APPETITE; FUTURE	Sijunzi decoction (SJZD) is a traditional Chinese medicine prescription which is used to treat spleen deficiency syndrome. Its mechanism of action was studied in a rat model of reserpine-induced spleen deficiency syndrome with metabolomics assays performed in normal control, model and Sijunzi decoction treated rats by liquid chromatography quadruple-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q/TOF-MS). Enzyme assays and histopathology, with multivariate statistical analysis, showed that Sijunzi decoction was an effective intervention in model rats. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the metabolite profiles of the model rats and normal control rats were completely separated, and that the profile of the Sijunzi decoction treated rats was similar to that of normal controls. Eighty potential biomarkers of Sijunzi decoction treatment were screened. The most relevant metabolic pathways were glycerophospholipid metabolism, elongation of fatty acids in mitochondria, synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies, fatty acid metabolism, ether lipid metabolism, synthesis of strontium scaffold, praline, degradation of leucine and isoleucine, and metabolism of methyl butyrate. An interaction network of metabolic pathways associated with potential biomarkers was constructed. Then, three potential target molecules of Sijunzi decoction intervention spleen deficiency syndrome including acetyl-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA and hexanoyl-CoA were screened. This study revealed the mechanism of Sijunzi decoction for the treatment of spleen deficiency syndrome and provided a theoretical basis for the clinical application of Sijunzi decoction.

Metabolomic studies using blood matrices have demonstrated interindividual and preanalytical variation of blood metabolites, whereas those of CSF metabolites remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to delineate the postprandial effects on CSF metabolites because fasting of patients with brain-related disorders is challenging. We collected pre- and postprandial (1.5, 3, and 6 h) plasma and CSF from nine healthy subjects. Using a mass-spectrometry-based global metabolomics approach, 150 and 130 hydrophilic metabolites and 263 and 340 lipids were detected in CSF and plasma, respectively. Principal component analysis of CSF hydrophilic metabolites and lipids primarily classified individual subjects at any time point, suggesting that the postprandial effects had a lower impact than interindividual variations on CSF metabolites. Individually, less than 10% of the CSF metabolites were putatively altered by postprandial effects (with either significant differences or over 2-fold changes, but not both) at any time point. Thus, global CSF metabolite levels are not directly associated with food intake, and except for several putatively altered CSF metabolites, postprandial effects are not a major concern when applying CSF metabolomics to screen biomarkers.
